   The Glenside IDE board memory map is as follows:
FFx0 - 1st 8 bits of DATA register
FFx1 - Error (read) / Features (Write) register
FFx2 - Sector count register
FFx3 - Sector # register
FFx4 - Cylinder low byte
FFx5 - Cylinder high byte
FFx6 - Device/head register
FFx7 - Status (read) / Command (Write) register
FFx8 - 2nd 8 bits of DATA register (latch)

    Please note, that if you are using ATAPI, most of these change
(which is why the current driver will not handle ATAPI, except for
detecting it's presence). (L. Curtis Boyle)

     It is unfortunately simplistic to say that the addresses are as
you say.  The first time an address is accessed (read), it sets up an
A/D conversion cycle for the channel as you specify above.  THEN the
next access is normally a read which reads the value converted from
the previous read access.  By doing a read on the next channel, you
set up the A/D conversion cycle for the channel read, but read the
previous channel's data. Here's another way to look at it.

Access(read)  address      data retrieved
    1        FF60        Whatever channel was set up last
    2        FF61        Data from channel #0 (X pos)

Due to a design error in the GIME, the "200-line" mode only displays
199 lines of active video on the screen.  If you do the BASIC pokes
for 25 lines on the WIDTH 40 and WIDTH 80 screens, you will see the
blinking underscore cursor disappear at the bottom line.  If the
graphic screens are poked for 200 lines, the bottom-most line will
be #198, not #199.  Try it and see. (Rodney V Hamilton)
