This CoCo 2 Emulator (coco.exe) and its accompanying add-ons were written
in Intel 16-bit assembly.  It can be assembled using Microsoft's Macro
Assembler.  If you are using MASM version 5.x or older, run BUILD5.BAT to
create the .EXEs.  If you are using MASM version 6.x, run BUILD6.BAT to
create the .EXEs.

The directory VER13RD contains the source code for the alternate versions
of RETRIEVE.EXE and DSKINI.EXE from version 1.3 of the CoCo 2 Emulator.

Please download coco2-16.zip for full details on the use and operation
of the CoCo 2 Emulator and its add-ons.

For copyright reasons, I am unable to make the 6809.asm module available in
its original form.  This 6809.asm works exactly as the original 6809.asm did;
however, this one is both smaller and much less optimised (i.e. slower).
