There are three versions of "The Interbank Incident" for Drivewire in this archive.
If you own a Speech Sound PAK, be sure to use it with this game.

An assumption was made that users of Coco1 and Coco2 computers would have composite
or TV monitors and only Coco3 users might have RGB monitors. The Coco1 and Coco2
versions use artifact colors for composite monitors. The Coco3 version is patched
to use PMODE3 graphics so that RGB monitors will show colors but the text is almost
impossible to read.
Coco3 users that want to read the text and don't care about colors on an RGB monitor
should use the Coco2 version; as should Coco3 users with composite/TV monitors.

There is no compensation for PAL systems.
