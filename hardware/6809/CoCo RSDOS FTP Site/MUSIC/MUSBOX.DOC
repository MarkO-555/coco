ABOUT THE PROGRAMMusic Box is a "shareware" adaptation of Musica. The original program  was written in 1983 and underwent numerous improvements over the next 2 years. After enjoying 4 years of success as a commercial program, the author decided to re-release it in this new guise. You are free to give this program to your friends provided that you do not charge a fee for it. You may not include this program as a part of a commercial program. If you enjoy the program, please let the author know. If you're feeling especially generous, include a contribution of any amount. $15 will register you and make you elegible for the next update and a printed manual. The more people who register, the more updates and improvements!

After a short pause, the TV screen will display treble and bass staves with a copyright notice. Press any key; the notice will erase and the memory and part indicators will appear. LOADING MUSICAfter loading the program as described above, press the "L" key. If you load from disk, a directory of the music files on the disk will be displayed. Enter the name of the music you want to load. If you have a cassette system, pressing ENTER without a name loads the next file. As soon as the composition has loaded, the screen will display the first 12 chords. Press the "P" key to play. If MUSIC BOX cannot find the file name you entered, the program will halt and Basic will give you an error message. Enter "RUN" and try again. ENTERING MUSIC Whenever you see a little flashing black box on the music score, you can enter or edit music. This flashing black box is called a cursor. It marks the exact spot in a composition where a command will take place. In the middle of the screen is a line that reads "1705=MEMORY   1=PART". MEMORY tells you how much room there is left for more music. PART is a reminder of which of the four possible parts you are entering music into. To enter a note, select the correct pitch by moving the cursor up and down with the arrow keys and then press ENTER. Since MUSIC BOX can play up to four notes at once, you must specify which part (or voice) you want a note to be in. This can be selected by pressing "V" and then "1", "2", "3", or "4". Sharps and flats may be entered by pressing either "S" or "F" before pressing ENTER. In addition to entering notes pitches by the up/down arrow, "S", and "F" keys, the right joystick can be used. First press the "J" key and try moving the joystick up and down. The cursor should move accordingly. When you have the cursor positioned correctly, press the "FIRE" button to enter a note. Sharps and flats are written by moving the joystick to the right for sharps and left for flats before pressing "FIRE". To turn the joystick off, press the "J" key again. While the joystick is on, you will notice that the cursor is gray instead of solid black. EDITING MUSIC If you press "ENTER" immediately after entering a new note, you will find that the note is erased. Individual notes can be changed this way. Of course, only the note in the voice part indicated by the "PART" marker will be affected. The cursor does not need to be positioned on the desired note; just line it up vertically (directly under or above) and press "ENTER". The desired note will disappear and the cursor will be positioned where the note was. In addition to changing individual notes, MUSIC BOX can add or delete chords. This requires the use of the "I" or "D" keys. Pressing the "I" key will copy the chord at the position of the cursor whereas the "D" key will delete the chord. CHANGING NOTE LENGTHS Position the cursor directly on, under, or above the chord you want to change (the vertical position is not important) and press 1 to get a whole note, 2 for a half note, 3 for a triplet, 4 for a quarter note, 5 for an eighth triplet note, 6 for a sixteenth note, 7 for a thirty-second note, 8 for a eighth note, and 9 for a sixty-fourth note. Note that all four notes in a chord are affected. It is not possible to write a chord with notes of different lengths. MUSIC BOX plays consecutive notes without a break between notes. This is important because it enables you to enter a note of any length. For example, to enter a dotted eighth note, enter an eighth note and then a sixteenth note of the same pitch. While you see two notes on the screen, when they are played you will hear only one, a dotted eighth note. If you want repeated notes to have breaks between them, you will have to insert rests between each note. A good rule of thumb is to half the note length, and make the rest the same value. For example, repeated quarter notes should be written as eighth notes with eighth rests between. When entering polyphonic music (music in which all the voices move independently of each other), remember that MUSIC BOX understands only chords. If the first part is moving in eighth notes but the fourth part is only half notes, the fourth part must be changed so that it is a string of 4 eighth notes for each half note. RESTS Rests are displayed as a blank space with a number over the middle C position indicating the value of the rest. This number has the same meaning as the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 described above for note values. To enter a rest, press "R". A rest will be entered at the cursor position. MOVING THE CURSOR QUICKLY Once you have entered a fair amount of music, there are some cursor commands that will save you time pressing the arrow keys. "B" will reset the cursor to the start of the music whereas "E" will position it at the end. Pressing "SHIFT" and either the right or left arrow keys will move you forward or backward until another key is pressed. "SHIFT" and either the up or down arrow keys will move the cursor up or down an octave. Another useful key is the "T" key which allows you to find the next tempo and tone table change marker (to be discussed). Any time you press a key during the playing of a composition, the music will immediately stop and you will be able to edit the composition. Normally the screen will return to the position in the music before you pressed "P"; the exception is if you press the key "U" which will cause the screen to update to the point at which you stopped the music. HANDLING MORE THAN ONE PART MUSIC BOX can handle up to 4 separate parts of music. Each part is called a "voice" and is numbered 1 through 4. Each part must be entered separately. Once you specify which part you want to work with by the "V" key, the program will enter all notes into that part until you specify another part. You can easily tell which part you are in by looking at the right hand side of the screen. Just after loading the program, you will see "1=PART". This means that all notes will be entered into the first part. You can change the part by pressing "V" and then 1, 2, 3, or 4. SAVING MUSIC To save a composition, press the "K" (keep) key. Enter the composition name and press "ENTER". HIGHLIGHTING PARTS When you have entered a large amount of music in four parts, it can be very difficult to figure out what notes are in part 1 (soprano) or which are in part 3 (tenor). This problem may be remedied with the "H" key. All parts except for the one selected are displayed in half-tone, making it very easy to follow a particular part through your composition. Note that the highlighting effect takes effect on all notes following the current cursor position, and that it has no effect on the actual music code stored in memory. ENTERING BARLINES Entering barlines will greatly improve the legibility of your music when you are in the process of editing it. Simply position the cursor at the spot you want a barline and press the "M" (measure) key. As you would expect, barlines have no effect on the music, but they do use up memory. MARKING REPEATS The "N" key can be used to mark sections of music that you wish to repeat when played. The beginning and end of each section to be repeated must be marked with this key. When you press the "N" key, a standard repeat bar will appear on the screen. MUSIC BOX keeps track of the start and end of repeat sections by changing the positions of the two pairs of dots. When the music is played, the first repeat bar is ignored until the second one is encountered. The program goes back to the previous repeat bar and continues playing. MUSIC BOX will not perform correctly if you start playing music in the middle of a repeat section. For best results, start playing music with the cursor positioned just before the start of a repeat section or at the very beginning of the music. NUMBERING BARLINES FOR FAST EDITING Barlines may easily be numbered to facilitate editing music. Press the "," key and numbers will appear above each barline. You may position the cursor at any barline by pressing the "Q" key, then three numbers corresponding to the desired barline. If the "ENTER" key is pressed instead of the three numbers, the previously entered number will be used. CHANGING TIMBRE AND VOLUME Each part may be assigned a particular timbre, or distinctive sound such as a flute, violin, or oboe. In MUSICA II, the timbre of each part is controlled by a list of numbers called a "tone table". There are four tone tables, numbered 1 through 4. You can generate new timbres for each tone table if you wish. All parts are assigned to tone 1 initially. You can change this assignment by pressing the "C" key. More on this in the next section. When you press the G key, two rows of numbers will appear. The first number in each group of 12 numbers identifies the table (1-4). Next is another number followed by a colon. This is the volume. After the colon are 8 numbers. These numbers control the timbre of the table and are called the harmonics. Each number represents the volume of that particular harmonic. You may change make any changes by moving the cursor around with the arrow keys and typing the desired numbers. When you are finished, press "ENTER". MUSIC BOX keeps track of the numbers you enter for each tone table while you use the program, and stores them with the music code on tape or disk. The best way to use this option is to do a lot of experimentation. Here are some suggested numbers to use:      1 9:90000000    Pure flute sound ("sine" wave)    1 9:99090000    Bright flutey sound    1 9:90900000    Imitation clarinet sound    1 9:98765432    Buzzy, reedy sound    1 9:90090009    Sparkling flutey sound    1 9:97250000    A good "basic" soundCHANGING TEMPO AND TONE TABLE ASSIGNMENTSThis command allows you to take full advantage of the many different sounds that can be synthesized with the "G" key. As previously mentioned, all 4 parts are assigned to tone table 1 initially. The "C" command allows you to change this assignment and also to change the tempo. After pressing "C", the screen will tell you what the last assignment was (4 numbers, corresponding to parts 1 through 4) and ask you to enter a new assignment. As soon as you have entered your assignments (pressing "ENTER" makes no change), they will be displayed vertically on the treble score. Next you will be asked to enter the tempo (the speed at which the music is played). You will be prompted to enter a number from 01 to 99 (you must enter 2 numbers). By pressing "ENTER", no change will be made. If you enter "1243" for the part assignments, part 1 will have the timbre of tone table #1, part 2 of #2, part 3 of #4, and part 4 of #3. Tone and tempo assignments may be made anywhere in the music as many times as you wish. Use this feature to give tonal variety to your composition, and to produce changes in speed (accellerandos and ritardandos). SPECIAL EFFECTS Two special effect keys are "X" (exchange) and "Y" (copy). The "X" key is of interest only if you have the STEREO PAK attached. It allows flip-flopping of the stereo channels (part 1 is exchanged with part 2, and 3 with 4). This effect starts at the current cursor position and continues to the end of music. Multiple flip-flops may be made through the music, producing an "echo" effect. The "Y" key can have a number of effects. It will copy the notes of a given part to a second part. Be careful when you use it because it will destroy whatever was in the second part (the part that was copied to). By pressing "0" in response to the prompt "DEPTH OF VIBRATO (0=NONE)?", the notes of one part will be copied exactly to the next. If, however, you press any other number key (1 through 9), a number proportional to the key you pressed will be subtracted from the first part before it is stored in the second. The second part now has notes that are slightly flat to the notes in the first. When a note is played with another note that is slightly flat, an undulating "beat" is created. This causes a useful effect when the music is played: vibrato or chorus, depending on the number pressed. Numbers 1 through 3 give a rather pleasing chorus effect, while higher numbers give a progressively faster vibrato. Remember, when you use this command, you reduce the number of available parts by one. When you use the "Y" command to produce a chorus or vibrato effect, MUSIC BOX will not be able to recognize the off-pitch notes. At any time the screen has to be updated (such as pressing "B"), MUSIC BOX will display a message "UNRECOGNIZED PITCH". This is just a reminder that you have used the "Y" key to create notes that do not have standard pitches. These non-standard notes are not displayed. They will sound correctly, however, when you use the "P" command. COPYING AND DELETING BLOCKS OF MUSIC Sections of music may be easily copied using the block move command. First mark the beginning of the section by pressing ".". Now move the cursor forward to one note after the end of the section and press "." again. Now move the cursor to where you want this block copied and press ".". A block of music may be deleted by first marking the start and end with the "." key then pressing "-" to delete. HIGH SPEED OPERATION If your computer is capable of running at twice the usual clock speed, you will be able to realize a significant improvement in the quality of sound from MUSIC BOX. Before you try this command, be sure you have saved whatever music you have in memory. This is because MUSIC BOX permanently alters the music code and your computer may lock up while attempting to run in the speeded up mode. In addition, all half and whole notes must be changed to quarter notes (use the insert to copy 4 quarter notes for each whole note, etc.). PRINTING MUSIC ON A PRINTER MUSIC BOX has a command that allows you to print music on a dot matrix printer that was set up during configuration. To print, press the "W" key. The printing will start where the cursor is and continue until the end of the music. Unless you have the registered user's version which allows you to configure MUSIC BOX for several different printers and Baud rates, you are limited to printing on a Radio Shack dot matrix printer at 600 Baud. ADDING A TITLE AND COMMENTS The ";" key allows you to write two lines of a message that is displayed every time the music is played. This is useful for giving specific directions on how to play the music, a copyright message, or a title. Use the right and left arrow keys to move the cursor and type in whatever you want. Exit by presing "BREAK" or "ENTER" twice. The "CLEAR" key erases the title. COMMAND SUMMARY   A:Additional commands (disk only)-user definable commands    may be loaded from disk and executed  B:Begin-reset the program to the start of the present    composition  C:Change-change the tone assignments for each part and the    tempo; pressing "ENTER" at each prompt will assign the    default (current) values  D:Delete-delete the chord (all 4 parts) at the position of    the cursor  E:End-move the cursor to the end of music F:Flat-make the next note entered flat G:Generate-create new timbre and volume H:Highlight-highlight a specified part I:Insert-insert a chord at the present position of the    cursor; the chord at the cursor position will be    duplicated  J:Joystick-turn on/off the option to use the right joystick    to select pitch; right/left positions of the joystick    correspond to sharp/flat; use the "FIRE" button to enter    notes; all other keys except for the up/down keys work as    before  K:Keep-save the present composition to disk or tape. L:Load-load a composition from disk or tape.
