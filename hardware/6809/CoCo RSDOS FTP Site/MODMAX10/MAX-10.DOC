    This set of files will allow you to patch Max-10 so that it will not need
the 'clicker' to run, and so that it will work with the Tandy Hi-res interface.
    You will need to have:

 1)  CRAK    /BIN
 2)  MAX SAVE/BAS
 3)  PATCH   /BAS
 4)  PATCH   /BIN
 5)  BOOT    /BAS
 6)  BOOT    /BIN (all saved together on a disk)
 7)  Two formatted disks,
 8)  A 512k COCO 3. (sorry, 128k just won't work)

Procedure
=========

1-  BACKUP your original Max-10 disk to the first formatted disk, and
COPY"CRAK/BIN" to the backup.

1a- If necessary, do a CONFIGure on the backed-up copy.

2-  LOAD"MAX"
   If it is configged, then type:
  51 LOADM"CRAK
   or else type:
  81 LOADM"CRAK

3-  RUN the loader program. (With the clicker installed)
    NOTE* every once in a while, for no apparent reason, Max-10 will crash
before it is running. If this happens, simply go back to step 2 until it works.

  4-  Once the program is up and running, and the arrow cursor is on the
screen, press the right joystick button.
    NOTE* Do not do anything, don't select a menu or type in any text or else
the patch will not work properly.
    The text cursor will stop flashing, and after a second you will return to
the 32-column screen, and you will see BASIC's sign-on message.

5-  LOAD"MAX SAVE"  and insert the second formatted disk. Then type RUN.

6-  The drive will whir and the program will inform you of what stage it is at.
After it is finished, you will have a copy of Max-10 on the disk.
    NOTE* This copy is STILL copyright by COLORWARE, so DO NOT hand it around.
This patch is NOT for the purpose of 'breaking' Max-10, but so that the
ORIGINAL buyer may use it without bothering with switching hi-res interfaces
and the clicker.

7-  using the COPY command, copy the last four programs to the second disk.
  i.e. PATCH/BAS, PATCH/BIN, BOOT/BAS, BOOT/BIN.

8-  RUN"PATCH"    The disk will go back and forth , and after a short wait
MAX-10 will load and run. You will be exactly where you left off.

    Now you have a copy of Max-10 on the disk, and whenever you want to use it
simply type RUN"BOOT" and it will be up and running in a few seconds.
