              WP2.BAS IS A WORD PROCESSOR WRITTEN IN BASIC AND HAS A LOT OF              GOOD FEATURES. TO GIVE YOU AS MUCH MEMORY AS POSSIBLE WE LEFT              THE INSTRUCTIONS OUT OF THE BASIC PROGRAM.                                      FUNCTIONS:   1- LIST - THIS COMMAND LISTS THE CONTENTS IN THE BUFFER. YOU HAVE A CHOICE            BETWEEN SHOWING THE WHOLE BUFFER OR JUST ONE LINE AT THE TIME.  2- EDIT - YOU CAN EDIT ONE LINE AT A TIME AND REPLACE ANY STRING OF            CHARACTERS IN THIS LINE. EXAMPLE: YOU TYPED 'HLLEO'. ENTER THE            STRING TO CHANGE 'LLE'<ENTER>  NOW TYPE THE NEW STRING 'ELL'.            THE WORD WILL NOW READ 'HELLO'.  3- SAVE - THIS COMMAND SAVES THE CONTENTS OF THE BUFFER TO DISK FOR LATER             USE.  JUST ENTER THE FILE NAME LIKE 'LETTER'.   THERE IS NO NEED            FOR AN EXTENTION,  THE PROGRAM WILL SAVE IT AS 'LETTER/TYP'  4-        AFTER YOU MADE SOME CORRECTION YOU MAY WANT TO CONTINUE THE TEXT.            JUST ENTER '4' AND IT GETS YOU TO THE NEXT LINE.  5- CHANGE SET -  USE THIS FEATURE AFTER YOU LOAD A FILE. THIS WAY IT WILL                   GET IN THE BUFFER.  6- PRINT - YOU CAN PRINT THE BUFFER. YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF HOW MANY LINES             YOU WANT TO PRINT. (HANDY FOR ADDRESSES) AND YOU ALSO CAN ENTER              THE VALUE FOR LEFT MARGIN. IT WORKS WITH ANY PRINTER !!  7- LOAD FILE - LOAD A FILE MADE WITH THIS OR ANY OTHER WORD PROCESSOR. JUST                 ENTER THE NAME AND EXTENTION.  HIT ENTER UNTIL YOU GET TO THE                 LAST LINE, THEN CONTINUE OR GO BACK TO THE MENU.  8- MERGE  - MERGE A FILE ON DISK TO THE ONE IN THE BUFFER.(APPEND)  9- INSERT - YOU CAN INSERT ONE LINE AT A TIME. 10- NEW/CLEAR  - YOU'LL BE ASKED: START OR MENU. TO ERASE ALL TEXT, ENTER S. 11- DELETE - YOU CAN DELETE ONE LINE AT A TIME. JUST ENTER THE LINE NUMBER.                                   SPECIAL KEYS:     SHIFT RIGHT ARROW --> GOES TO MAIN MENU. USE IT TO EXIT THE TEXT MODE.     SHIFT DOWN ARROW  --> PRINTS CHR$ 27(ESC). USE IT FOR PRINTER COMMANDS                           LIKE UNDERLINE, BOLD, LINEFEED AND OTHERS.     THIS PROGRAM WILL BE EXTENDED IN THE FUTURE.     NEXT ADD-ONS WILL BE FORM LETTER AND INVOICE.
