MLFINDER.BIN is a short binary file for the Color Computer which tells
you the load address, end address, and execution address for binary
files on a disk base system. It also supplies the track, sector, and
byte at which the code starts on the disk. Data can be sent to a
printer.

The program will work with all versions of the Coco, although the help
message was formatted for the wide screen Coco3.
