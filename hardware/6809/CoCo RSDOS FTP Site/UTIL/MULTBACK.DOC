         Multi-Back 1.0               by        Dave GreathouseReleased in the Public Domain            8/21/85  To obtain a working copy of Multi-Back, eitherdownload the machine language program directly(using VIDTEX or XMODEM protocols) or downloadonly the basic loader program from this database.To use the basic loader program just LOAD theprogram in and RUN it. It will automaticallycreate the machine language program "MULTBACK/BIN"on the default drive.  Multi-Back is a Multiple disk drive backuputility that will allow up to 3 copies of a diskto be made at one time. The program is simple touse, So you shouldn't have too much difficulty ingetting it to work!   When the program asks for the number of drivesavailable, answer 2-4 depending on the number ofdrives in your system. Multi-Back will then tellyou to place the source disk in drive 0 and thedestination disk(s) in the remaining drive(s).Press any key to continue with the back up. Youmay abort the backup by pressing and holding downthe break key. If an I/O error occurs, you willwill be asked if you would like to abort thebackup completely, ignore the error and continuewith the backup, or try to read the bad sectoragain. When the backup is complete you will beasked if you have any more disks to backup,answering with a 'Y' will restart the program,anything else will return you to BASIC.  Please note... this is not a "Cracker" type ofprogram. This will copy only disks that are notcopy protected! It will however, sometimes allowyou to backup a disk that would not work with theregular BACKUP command because of its ability toretry and ignore errors that sometimes occur dueto normal disk wear. If you have any questionsregarding this program leave me a note via theColor SIG or Easy-Plex.  Dave Greathouse 73206,3213
