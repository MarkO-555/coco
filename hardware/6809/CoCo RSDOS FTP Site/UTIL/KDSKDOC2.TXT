14.   <N>UMBER  FIND - Used with options DUMP SECTOR,  EDIT SECTOR and  HEX
DUMP.  Searches   screen display  for  selected numbers (in hex).   Inverts
screen display for easy location.
 
     To use:
 
      a.  Select option <N>.
 
      b.  Type in HEX digits to search for (12 digits max).
 
      c.  Use with other dump or edit options.
 
      d.  To turn NUMBER FIND off,   Press ENTER instead of entering digits
          to find.
 
 
15.   <O>PTS  A S=*  D=* - Sets the default drives for other menu  options.
The first parameter is 'A' or 'F'.  'A' is for absolute disk addressing and
'F' is for file addressing. S is source drive,  D is for destination drive.
If  an automatic  default  is  not desired,   hit  enter  instead  of drive
number.   Menu  displays  default values  selected.  Asterix  indicates  no
default  value.   Use  arrow  keys to change baud rate.  Press  ENTER  when
correct  baud rate appears.   The left margin can be set from 0 to 9 for  a
cleaner  print  out.  However,  some features of KDSK (LIBRARY) use  an  80
column listing.  To use the margins and avoid line wrapping on the printer,
set printer to 12 CPI instead of the normal 10 CPI.
 
      To use:
 
      a.  Select option <O>.
 
      b.  Answer  prompts for source and destination  drives.   Use   ENTER
          for no default drive.
 
      c.  <A>bsolute or <F>ile disk access - Select 'A' or 'F' or hit ENTER
          to leave as is. The current setting is the Inverted letter.
 
      d.  Select baud rate for printer (Use up/down arrow keys).
 
      e.  Select left margin if desired.
 
 
16.   <P>ASSWORD -  Encrypts and decrypts files with the key word or phrase
you provide.
 
     To use:
 
      a.  Select  option <P> when main menu is on the screen.
 
      b.  Select drive and select file to encrypt/decrypt.
 
      c.  Enter key word or phrase. Phrase can be up to 255 characters long.
 
Warning: Key word or phrase must be exactly the same to decrypt a file.
 
17.   <Q>UIT - Aborts the program and returns to Basic.   Takes program out
of memory.
 
 
18.   <R>ECOVER   DIRECTORY - Will retrieve the backup directory (if  saved
with  first  the SAVE DIRECTORY option) and restore it  to   the   original
location (RS format only).  Restored  directory  will  be  the same as when
last  saved  (by  SAVE  option or COPY  option).   A  directory  cannot  be
recovered  unless   it   was   first   saved.    Used  to  recover  crashed
directories (explained later).
 
     To use:
 
      a.  Select option <R>.
 
      b.  Answer prompt for source drive.
 
 
19.   <S>AVE   DIRECTORY   - Use  of  this option  will  save  the  granule
allocation  table and directory (RS format only) in the upper half  of  the
directory track.  This  area  on the  disk cannot be accessed during normal
disk  use  and is usually dead space on the disk.   As such,   use of  this
option will not tie up a granule of  disk space  as  some  other  directory
saving  schemes do.   Use of this option and RECOVER DIRECTORY  option  can
help to recover a crashed disk.
 
     To use:
 
      a.  Select option <S>.
 
      b.  Answer prompt for source drive.
 
 
20.   <T>RACKS  = 35/18 - Sets the maximum  tracks  and  sectors  that  can
be accessed by the other menu options.   Can be set for any number from  00
to 99.  Current status is displayed on the main menu.
 
     To use:
 
      a.  Select option <T>.
 
      b.  Answer  prompts  for  maximum number of tracks  and  sectors  per
          track.  Answer with 2 digit numbers (09 instead of 9).
 
Note  that  if  tracks are set to 40,   option <I> will format  40  tracks,
option <B> will backup 40 tracks, etc...
 
 
21.   <U>PLOAD  - Uploads machine language or  basic  programs  from   tape
and transfers  program  to  disk (RS format).   Displays  start,  end,  and
exec  addresses  for machine language programs.  Has options to  skip  over
files if desired.
 
     To use:
 
      a.  Select option <U>.
 
      b.  Ready   cassette   and  press  ENTER   when   prompted.    Option
          will automatically write file to disk.
 
 
22.   <V>ERIFY   -  Acts   as   a   toggle  switch for  the  verify  on/off
command.  Current status is displayed on the main menu.  When verify is on,
each  track written is immediately re-read to insure write was  successful.
This  slows  down  all  disk writes and is  recommended  only  if  you  are
experiencing problems with a disk or drive.
 
     To use:
 
      a.  Select option <V>. Current status is displayed on main menu.
 
 
23.  <W> FLEX TO RS -  Converts Flex formatted files to RS format. JOB must
be  set on appropriate Flex format option.  Converted file is put on target
drive and source file is untouched.  This option is limited to ASCII  files
and  binary  files with one load address (Most binary files have  only  one
load address).
 
     To Use:
 
      a.  Set JOB to correct Flex format.
 
      b.  Select  Option <W> from main menu and answer questions for source
          and target drives.
 
      c.  A  list of Flex files on the source disk will be displayed with a
          letter  preceding  each filename.  Select files by letter  to  be
          converted to RS format and hit ENTER.
 
 
24.   <X>   EXAMINE   TRACK  -  Allows  you  to examine an entire track  of
data,  including control data on the disk.  Uses the same  format  as  DUMP
command.   Press any key to display next screen and <LEFT ARROW> to go back
one  screen.  Displays bytes viewed in upper right corner in hex and can be
used with NUMBER FIND.
 
     To use:
 
      a.  Select option <X>.
 
      b.  Answer prompt for source drive.
 
      c.  Displays  64  bytes at a time.  Any key advances to next  screen.
          <LEFT ARROW> goes back 64 bytes.
 
 
 
                                 SPECIAL KEYS
 
The  following  commands can be used for those options above that  use  the
arrow keys (not all commands apply in all cases):
 
     <UP ARROW>         -  Goes to next track.
 
     <DOWN ARROW>       -  Goes to previous track.
 
     <RIGHT ARROW>      -  Goes to next sector.
 
     <LEFT ARROW>       -  Goes to previous sector.
 
     <SPACE BAR>        -  Goes to next page.
 
     <->                -  Starts option or page over.
 
     <BREAK>           -  Aborts  and  returns  to main menu.  Can be  used
                          with any option any time program is waiting   for
                          a response.
 
     <CLEAR>             - Same  as break key only does not  display  Title
                           page.
 
     <SHIFT><UP ARROW>  - Sends screen  contents to printer.  Can be used  at
                          any time.
 
 
                         RECOVERING A CRASHED DISK
 
     There  are several ways to recover a crashed disk with KDSK.  The most
common crash is in the directory track (track 17). The first thing to do is
use BACKUP to make a copy of the readable sectors on a crashed  disk.  Each
time  KDSK stops with a disk error,  note the track & sector  number,  then
press  the space bar to continue.  If the error was a CRC error,  there's a
good  chance  the  data is still intact and the backup  will  work  as  the
original did. If not, read on...
 
     Recovering  the directory is easy now if you used the SAVE  option  or
used COPY to copy a file to the disk before it crashed.  Use RECOVER on the
backup  disk and your directory will be restored the same image as the last
SAVE or COPY.
 
     Another  method  is INITIALIZE (format) just  the  bad  sector.  (KDSK
actually  must reformat the entire track but rewrites the readable  sectors
when  it's finished).  Hit return for the fill character and KDSK will fill
the  bad  sector  with whatever data can be  read  after  initializing  the
sector.  Again,  if you had only CRC errors, you may be finished, otherwise
follow the directions in previous paragraph.
 
 
                             CUSTOMIZING KDSK
 
    KDSK  UTILITY  can be  customized  by  changing  the   verify   status,
default  drive  status,  printer baud rate (use up/down arrow keys), number
of  tracks,  number of sectors/track,  etc  on loading to reflect what  you
normally use with your system.   To change,  select <Y> on initial load and
answer  questions.
 
  When  asked   for   printer   control   characters,    answer   in   hex,
including  escape characters if  needed.  Be sure to use leading zeros when
entering  hex numbers (Ex:  use 0F not F,  and use 01 instead of  1).   Hit
enter  if  no  changes  are  needed.   KDSK  is initially setup up for Star
Printers as follows:
 
     Normal Print    =  1B351B481B461B4201
 
           1B 35    selects standard character set.
           1B 48    cancels double-strike printing.
           1B 46    cancels emphasized printing.
           1B 42 01 sets pitch to 10 characters/inch (Pica).
 
     Condensed Print  =  1B4303
 
           1B 43 03  sets pitch to 17 characters/inch.
 
     Expanded Print   =  0E1B451B341B47
 
           0E        selects expanded print for rest of line.
           1B 45     selects emphasized printing.
           1B 34     selects italics.
           1B 47     selects double-strike printing.
 
 
                                 GLOSSARY
 
RS          - Radio  Shack - used to mean standard Radio Shack disk  format
            (35 tracks,  18 sectors/track,  directory in track  17,  double
            density,  single  sided,  files linked via Granule  Table,  256
            bytes sectors)
 
Flex        - Flex  Operating  System  - used to mean  standard  Flex  disk
            format  (Single  sided 40 tracks,  18 sectors/tracks or  Double
            sided 40 tracks,  36 sectors/track,  double density with  track
            zero  single density,  directory starting in track zero,  files
            linked via first 4 bytes of each sector, 256 byte sectors)
 
MS-DOS       - MS-DOS/PC-DOS  Operating System - used to mean  MS-DOS  disk
            format (Single or double sided, double density, 40 tracks, 8 or
            9 sectors/track, Directory starting in track zero, files linked
            via File Allocation Table (FAT), 512 byte sectors)
 
                         SPECIAL NOTES/SHORT CUTS
 
1. When asked for track number on DUMP or EDIT sectors, if you reply with a
"D", you will get the directory track (track 17, sector 3).
 
2.  The  drive  being  accessed is in the upper left corner of  the  screen
(DR=#).
 
3. When editing a sector, moving the arrow keys off the top row advances to
the  next page.  An easy way to get the last character of the first line is
do go down one line and backup one character.
 
4. For double sided drives, add 4 to drive number to access the second side
of the drive.  For example, drive 4 would be the second side of drive 0 and
drive 5 would be the second side of drive 1.
