                              GoldRunner 2000                 Copyright 1997 (c) MediaLink Development                         Written by Chet SimpsonGoldRunner 2000 (GR2K) is neither "shareware" of "freeware".  It has beenrelease so CoCo owners  can see the results of "The Challenge" that wasissued by Eric Crichlow almost 5 months ago.This 'preview' requires 512k and has not been tested on 1mb or 2mbCoCo III's.  If you have a 1mb or 2mb CoCo III and exprerience problemsplease contact MediaLink development giving a detailed descriptionof the problem (MEDIALINK@DELPHI.COM)..There are several differences between GR2K and the upcoming release ofDigger II: Return of the Saint.  The main difference is that GR2K useslooped sound samples for its musical sound tracks. D2 uses actual 2channel digital music similar to .MOD files on the Amiga and PC.  Thereis a very good chance that we will be releasing a demo of the sound systemthat plays 4 channel digital samples very cleanly (We can't tell much of adifference between an 8bit sound blaster and the Orch-90 pak!).Installation:Use The Compressor V1.01 to decompress GR2K-1.ARC onto a freshly formatteddisk.  Label this disk "GR2K: Boot Disk".USe The Compressor V1.01 to decompress GR2K-2.ARC onto a freshly formatteddisk.  Lebel this disk "GR2K: Level Disk".Running:Insert the "GR2K: Boot Disk" into drive 0 and type:  LOADM"GR2K"and press [ENTER].You should soon be greeted with the MediaLink logo screen and the gamewill continue to load.  Once the title page is loaded the intro scorewill begin to play. After a few seconds you will be requested to pressany key to continue.After you press a key, the finial portion will be loaded and you willbe requested to insert Disk 2, side 1 into the drive.You should now insert Disk 2 and press a key to continue.You should now see the main option screen.  From here you have a choiceof viewing the credits, playing a keyboard or joystick game or warping toa completed level.Warping:When you select 'warp' from the main option screen, you will be askedfor the 'warp code' of the desired level.  Simply enter it in and pressenter and you will be taken directly to that level.  If an invalidwarp code is entered, the computer will scold you harshly!Playing:The object is to complete each level by collecting all of the gold bars andleaving through the escape ladder.Each level has 5 gaurds attempting to thwart your efforts of collectingthe gold and escaping.  Not only will they chase you, but they will pickup gold bars are they move (only one per gaurd).If a gaurd has picked up a gold bar, the only way to retrieve it is to diga hole and let him fall into it.  Once that happens the gold bar will appearabove him and you can pick it up.  But beware, gaurds will only stay trappedin the whole for so long before they manage to get out.Beware of closing holes!Keyboard control:When playing a keyboard game, use the left and right arrow keys to moveleft or right (respectivly), the [ALT] key to move up and the [CTRL] keyto move down.  Use the spacebar to dig.Joystick controls:To play a game using the joystick, it must be plugged into the rightjoystick port.  If using a 2 button joystick, use button one (on the top)to dig.Completing a level:Whenever you complete a level, you are given a warp code.  This is useful ifyou want to directly 'warp' to the next level when starting a game.Keyboard commands:While playing the game, the following heys can be used to do differentthings:            Key      Use   -------------------------------    S       Toggles music on/off (usefull as it really gets annoying!)    P       Pauses the game    [BREAK] In the event you work yourself into a corner, you an restart            the level, by pressing this key.All questions and comments should be directed to MEDIALINK@DELPHI.COM--------------------------------------------------------------------------                          *** PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT ***      ...As you reach the exit of the cavern,  you are eagerly greeted      by the Guards of the Gold.  Saying nothing, they slap you in the      face, drag you  back  into the  depths of  the earth and  entomb      you in a small niche.  Left to  die, your screaming  and clawing      at the rock walls go unnoticed.  Suddenly, the earth  begins to      violently shake and the ground beneath you cracks open.      As you look through the opening,  you notice no movement, no      sound, no activity  what-so-ever.  You  quickly jump  through,      falling  to the floor.  As you get up you notice that you are      back in the mines of Ling  except this  mine is  full of      diamonds, BIG diamonds.  As you  grab a  shovel hanging  on the      cavern wall several guards come charging in after you and once      again, the chase begins...            MediaLink Development is proud to announce the upcoming release      of "Digger II: Return of the Saint", the latest game to hit the      CoCo.
