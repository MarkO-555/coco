I'm Gene Turnbow, former SYSOP of the Tesseract system on StgNet.

C-Trek was probably the first commercial version of Color Computer
Star Trek, and was written in 1980 by myself and published by 
Spectral Associates of Seattle, Washington.

There were two versions of the game.  Fearing reprisal from Paramount
Pictures regarding trademark issues, they had me remove references to
the Enterprise and the Klingons.  Shortly thereafter, they went out of 
business.  Very few copies of version 1.1 of the game were ever distributed.

The was written on a 16K Color Computer 1, and at the time I 
did not have Extended Color BASIC.  This, of course, meant
that every time I made a typographical error or had a bug to
correct, I had to slavishly retype the entire line.

The game was sold between 1980 and 1982.  At some point Spectral
went out of business, and the rights reverted to me.  Now, I'm giving 
the game to the world as my gift to the Coco users who are still 
out there.

Since writing C-TREK, I have had three careers, finally ending up writing
computer games professionally for Windows95, distributed on CD-ROM.  I still
have my old Coco, and it still runs great!  If you want to email me, you can

I hope you have as much fun playing C-TREK as I did writing it.
