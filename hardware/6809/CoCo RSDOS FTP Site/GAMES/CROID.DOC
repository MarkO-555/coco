CROID
by Andrew Simpson (andydrew@powerup.com.au)

I  wish to thank ANDREW McGEE author of the joystick and fade routines used
in  this  program.   NICKOLAS MARENTES for help with graphics and hints and
tips that made the program possible.

	You  are trapped in a large maze.  You must of course get out.  But
before you do that you need to plant a bomb.  The bomb that you have has no
power.  To charge the bomb you must walk over charge plates.

    There  is  one  in every room.  So you go from room to room charging up
the  bomb.  When you walk over a plate some of the energy is used to charge
your  DEFLECTOR SHIELD, bomb timer, and to increase your PLAST BOLT battery
capacity.   When  you  have sufficient power then go to the drop off point.
This  is  displayed  on  the map as a yellow dot.  (you are the white one).
The power left in the timer is used in the next level.
	When  you  walk  over the hole in the floor the bomb countdown will
start.  You then need to get to the pickupup point.  (the orange dot on the
map)

	When  you  walk  over  the  transfer plate you are sent to the next
maze.

	Things you will meet on the way.

		LROIDS

	These are your enemies (well, one of them).  They seem to just walk
aimlessly,  but they are all looking after a different part of the chamber.
When  they are in position they will fire at you.  There is nothing you can
do  to avoid their BOLT but to hide behind a wall.  To get them out of your
way just shoot them.

		CRUDS

	Not  even the LROIDS like them.  They attach themselves to the side
of  a wall and crawl around it.  When they get bored they will jump over to
another  wall.   When  they  get close to you they attach a hose to you and
suck  the  deflector  shield  power out of you.  To stop them, hit the wall
just  in  front  of them.  They will stay powerless for five seconds.  Just
enough  time  to get past.  (The cruds, when powerless will hover whereever
they  are  hit.   When  they  regain  power,  they  may  not go in the same
direction.) They can also fire over the wall.


    CROID'S CONTROL

    Using  the  right  joystick, button one (black) engages movement in the
direction  that the joystick is pointing.  Pressing button two (red), fires
a bolt.  This bolt may then be guided by holding down the button and moving
the  joystick  in  the  direction  you  want.   How far the bolt will go is
governed  by  the  amount  of  power  you  have  stored.   When the bolt is
destroyed,  the  battery  will slowly recharge.  Every time you move over a
charge plate your battery capacity will be increased.

	SHIELD

	The  CROID's  shield  level is displayed at the bottom right of the
display bar.  When you walk over the plate your power will be increased.

	ENTERING YOUR NAME IN THE HIGH SCORES

	Using  the  joystick,  move  it  left or right to guide the marker.
When  it  is under the letter you want, press the red button.  When you are
finished, press the black button.

	SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

	128K Color Computer 3, Color TV or RGB monitor.
	1 disk drive
	a 2 button joystick

	or

	2 one button joysticks (if you only have one button joysticks, then
wherever it says "button two (black)" use the button on the left joystick.
