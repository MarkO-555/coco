<P>
When the Coco3 was released by Tandy, I stopped working on a Semigraphics-24
sketching program I had written. I have recently been using Jeff
Vavosour's Coco2 emulator and was surprised to find that the semigraphics-24
mode is fully supported and my program runs correctly.
<P>
Since there has been renewed interest in both the emulator and
the Coco 1&amp;2 based on the Coco listserver traffic, I have
posted my program to <A HREF="ftp://os9archive.rtsi.com/RSDOS/incoming/">ftp://os9archive.rtsi.com/RSDOS/incoming/</A>.
The program is complete but in bare bones form; no bells and whistles.
Nevertheless, it is a good example of a little publicized or used
SAM mode on the original Coco; a graphics screen with 9 true colors
plus text.
<P>
I expect there are now more emulator than Coco2 users so the posting
is in .DSK format. On the &quot;disk&quot; is a Basic loader,
the machine language program, and an example sketch. The file
name is Semi24.dsk.
<P>
If you know how to use the emulator, you won't have trouble with
S24.DSK. However, for help, comments, or discussion, contact Robert
