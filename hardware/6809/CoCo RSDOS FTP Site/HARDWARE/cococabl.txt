Over the years many have asked for the pinouts of the various cables used for telecommunications with the CoCo. The following is an attempt to gather all of that information in one source. This information comes from various forum messages. Most of the credit goes to Marty Goodman as most if not all of the messages were his. This information was not collected in electronic form but was collected from written copies. So there may possibly be a typo or so although the information should be correct. If you do spot a typo or if you have any problems using any of these cables please leave me a message so I can correct this file. This file covers the following cables. CoCo 4 pin to DB25 modem cableCoCo 4 pin to DB25 null modem cable (used to connect between two machines)CoCo 4 pin to DB9  null modem cable (usually a PC and a CoCo with out using)RS232 pak  to DB25 null modem cable (any modem though you still need)RS232 pak  to DB9  null modem cable (terminal software on both machines) CoCo 4 pin to DB25 modem cable 1              8    2              3 3              7 4              2 CoCo 4 pin to DB25 and to DB9 null modem cable 1          20,6,8       1,4,6   Short the multiple pins on DB and continue 2             2           3     wire to pin 1 on CoCo end.

If you put both the IBM DB 25 and the IBM DB 9conectors on the cable, and the CoCo connector on the cable,you will have a cable that will link in null modem fashion a CoCo toEITHER a 25 or 9 pin DB serial port on a PC.   But you cannot usethat cable to link two PC compatibles in null modem fashion!  Adifferent pin out is required for that.   ---marty
