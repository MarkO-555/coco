Merrry Christmas 2000 to the CoCo Community!

Here is a full-featured Simulated Hard drive for Jeff Vavasour's CoCo 3 Emulator and OS9 Level II.

This hard drive is pack with some nice programs, and is ready to dive into and start programming with
the many languages and tools that are on it.

By using the boot disk in drive zero and typing the DOS command, you are booted into OS9 Level II with
2 MEG memory, /dd as your hard drive, and Multi-Vue and two OS9 device windows 80x24 in size.

I hope to see other peoples hard drives appear here also, if the space is available!

You need to have the available extended memory to take advantage of the 2 MEG memory.
I find that the CoCo 3 Emulator runs real good in a DOS window on Windows 98, Windows Me.
Just make sure you tell it to use the full screen size.

If you don't have the CoCo 3 Emulator, I would suggest that you get it because it works real good!
For those that have only have a real CoCo 3 there are some nice *.DSK in the dsk directory.

Also my CoCo projects are in the project directory, this way I can keep all my work together in
one location and of course this is all zipped up for easy down loading.
