<P><FONT size=5><I>L</I></FONT><FONT size=2><I>ONG </I></FONT><FONT 
size=1><I>AGO, in the faraway hamlet of Rivenshire, there lived a gentle, simple 
folk. For many long years they lived, loved and labored in the seclusion of the 
peaceful valley, protected from the influence and danger of the outside world by 
the towering mountains of Daggorath.</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><I>But alas, no good thing remains untouched forever. And so it 
was, in the time now known as the Year of Darkness, that a monstrous Evil came 
to Rivenshire, and the shadows of Daggorath fell long upon the land. The crops, 
once healthy and strong, stood withered in the fields. The herds of cattle and 
sheep wandered in listless stupor and slowly wasted away. Even the children of 
the Shire became ill and did not respond to the most powerful 
potions.</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><I>In desperation, the people cried out for a reason, for 
understanding, for deliverance. Then a wise old master of the village came forth 
to speak . . . </I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=5><SUP><I>"</I></SUP><I>T</I></FONT><FONT size=1><I>here is a 
tale," he said, "passed down for centuries and almost forgotten, of a time in 
the Olden Days when a curse such as this descended on the land. Deep beneath 
these towering crags, in the Dungeons of Daggorath, an evil Wizard made his home 
and grew in power But before his destruction of the land was complete, a brave 
adventurer ventured into the fearsome Dungeons and drove the Wizard away, saving 
Rivenshire from a devilish fate. The Wizard, however, was not destroyed and 
swore, even as he fled, that one day he would return with his legions of evil, 
more powerful than ever, to reinhabit the Dungeons of Daggorath and destroy all 
the land to avenge his defeat. I have heard rumors in recent times that this 
same Wizard has come into possession of the ancient and mighty Ring of Endings 
and is now more powerful than even I fear that this is true and that he has 
returned to destroy us."</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=5><I>A</I></FONT><FONT size=1><I>nd lo, the people of the village 
trembled and begged of the master, "What shall we do... who now will save us?" 
When the crowd was silent, the master spoke. "Behold this Book," he said, 
raising the ancient volume above his head for all to see, "for it is said to 
have been left by the adventurer and was passed down to me by my father's 
father's father. It tells of the mysteries and dangers of the Dungeon. The 
secrets of The Book I can share with you. But alas, where will we find one so 
bold as to face the deadly dangers of the Dungeons of Daggorath?"</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1><I>To the amazement of all who watched, there came from the 
crowd a stranger whose face spoke of courage and wisdom. The stranger reached 
out a hand to take The Book. The master smiled slowly and said, "Even as it was 
prophesied. . . so be it. I shall teach you the ways of the Dungeon that you may 
venture forth and slay the Wizard. You must listen carefully and study well, for 
mistakes are deadly in the Dungeons of Daggorath." Thus began the lesson.

<P><A name=Introduction><FONT face=Arial><B>Introduction</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>The animated color graphics of this exciting 
adventure game make your task tearfully realistic. The Dungeon is a complex, 
multi-level maze deep within the mountains of Daggorath and tilled with evil 
creations of the Wizard - fearsome creatures that can snuff out your fragile 
existence in an instant. Beware... for once you have been transported into the 
Dungeon, there are only two ways out: <B>DESTROY THE WIZARD or 
DIE!</B></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A name="Required Equipment"><FONT face=Arial><B>Required 
Equipment</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>To begin your adventure, you need the 
following:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol size=1>·</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=1> A Tandy® Color 
Computer with at least 16k RAM</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Symbol size=1>·</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=1> Standard TV (Color 
recommended)</FONT></P>
<P><A name="Loading Instructions"><FONT face=Arial><B>Loading 
Instructions</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>1. Before inserting or removing a Program Pak&#8482; 
cartridge, make sure the computer is off. Failure to do so could result in 
damage to the Program Pak.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>2. Connect the Color Computer to the television set, 
and move the antenna switchbox control to Computer (or Game). See your Tandy 
Color Computer Operation Manual for further details regarding 
connections.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>3. Insert the Dungeons of Daggorath Program Pak&#8482;, 
label side up, into the slot located on the right side of the computer. Press 
firmly until it engages securely, but do not force it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>4. Turn on the television, and tune it to Channel 3 
or 4 (whichever is least active in your area).</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A name="Playing the Game"><FONT face=Arial><B>Playing the 
Game</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>To begin your adventure, you must first be 
transported to the Dungeon. After loading the program, a chilling preview of the 
mysteries of the Dungeon appears on the screen. You might even catch a glimpse 
of the Wizard himself! Read through The Book, and when you think you can 
successfully complete your task, press any key to be transported into the 
Dungeon. But first, you must know more of the evil sanctum you are about to 
enter.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A name="The Display"><FONT face=Arial><B>The Display</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>You can view the Dungeon at the top of the screen. A 
single line on the left and right sides of the screen shows what you are holding 
in your left and right hands. The center of the screen monitors your heartbeat. 
You can actually see your heart and hear its beating as you wind your way 
through the dark passages of horror. Enter commands at the tour line command 
entry area at the bottom of the screen.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=729 src="Dungeons of Daggorath Program_files/DAGGOR3.jpg" 
width=700></P>
<P><A name=Commands><FONT face=Arial size=3><B>Commands</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>To enter commands in the Dungeon, type the desired 
command, with spaces between the words of multi-word commands, and press [ENTER] 
If you make a mistake in typing a command, press the [&lt;-] key to erase one 
character at a time and continue typing the command. It you enter an illegal or 
impossible command, ??? appears after the command, and no action is 
taken.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>You can enter commands in rapid succession. Simply 
continue typing. The computer stores the commands you type and then displays and 
carries them out as rapidly as possible.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Commands can be abbreviated to the shortest set of 
letters that cannot be confused with another command word. For example, ATTACK 
LEFT can be abbreviated A L, and PULL LEFT SWORD can be abbreviated P L SW. 
SWORD cannot be abbreviated with just an S, as this can be confused with SHIELD. 
You must still enter spaces between abbreviated words. If you try to enter an 
abbreviation that is too short, ??? appears after the command.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The appendices at the end of The Book contain a 
Summary of Commands (Appendix A), a Partial List of Allowable Abbreviations 
(Appendix B), and the commands you need to use to save and reload a game 
(Appendix C).</FONT></P>
<P><A name="Moving In the Dungeon"><FONT face=Arial size=3><B>Moving In the 
Dungeon</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Enter the command MOVE to step one cell forward in 
the Dungeon. If you are facing a wall, you will "bump" into it. You may move 
past a creature that is directly in front of you by moving forward. The 
creature, however, will follow you and attempt to move fast enough to jump back 
in front of you.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>To step back, type MOVE BACK. You can also turn in 
either direction by typing TURN LEFT or TURN RIGHT. Type TURN AROUND to turn 
completely around in the same cell. Use the commands MOVE LEFT or MOVE RIGHT to 
sidestep (move sideways without turning).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>A TORCH will help you see which way to MOVE in the 
Dungeon. You can MOVE with no TORCH (in total darkness), but you will bump into 
walls. This is not a recommended method of traveling in the Dungeon, for you 
might bump into the dreaded creatures.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A name="Levels and Climbing In the Dungeon"><FONT face=Arial 
size=3><B>Levels and Climbing In the Dungeon</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Dungeon is a multi-level maze. There are three 
known levels, but there are rumors that the real Wizard lives beyond in even 
deeper levels. If you want to explore the first three levels, you must find a 
hole or a ladder to move between the levels. Beyond that, you are on your 
own.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If you are standing next to a hole, type CLIMB DOWN. 
You are then on the level below and can see the hole you just climbed through 
directly above you. But be careful... if you climb down a hole, you cannot go 
back up.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>It you are standing next to a ladder, you can move up 
or down by using the commands CLIMB UP or CLIMB DOWN. Be especially wary of 
climbing up... for it is said that if the Wizard senses you retreating up a 
level, he will punish your faintheartedness with the wrath of his most fearsome 
creatures.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A name=Creatures><FONT face=Arial size=3><B>Creatures</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Dungeon is filled with terrible creatures, 
henchmen of the evil Wizard. You will encounter Vipers, Spiders, Evil Knights, 
the Smiling Blobs, massive Stone Giants, Scorpions, Wraiths, and the awesome 
Galdrogs. These demons of darkness will attempt to seek you out and destroy you. 
They grow more powerful and more deadly as you descend deeper into the 
Dungeon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Each creature has a characteristic sound that it will 
sometimes make as it approaches from any direction. The sound grows louder as 
the creature approaches. Listen carefully in the Dungeon, for you can often tell 
which creature to expect from the sound you hear. If the creature is in the cell 
with you, the sound is very loud, and you will be attacked. You will hear the 
blow strike you if it finds its mark. This is extremely hazardous to your 
health.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If you have your wits about you, you can use the 
ATTACK command to fend off or destroy your attacker. Use an object (such as a 
SWORD) if you have one, but your empty hand is better than nothing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>One technique you might use to defeat creatures 
involves attacking several</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>times in rapid succession and then moving several 
steps and turning around. This method lets your heart rate slow down while the 
creature approaches. Then you are ready to attack again as the creature enters 
your cell.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Creatures attack faster as they become more powerful. 
Time your attack to strike the creature just as it enters your cell and before 
it has a chance to strike you. Entering several ATTACKS followed by MOVES in 
rapid succession (don't wait for the command to be displayed) helps to get your 
blows in and gets you out of danger before the creature has a chance to destroy 
you.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Blob might require ten or so successful sword 
hits to kill when you first encounter it. The Stone Giant might take six or 
seven hits to destroy. You might be able to kill Spiders with only one blow, but 
Vipers will take two or three.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Both the Blob and the Stone Giant can often kill you 
with one blow - so be quick and move before they strike!</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In the Dungeon, the victor of a struggle draws 
strength from the defeated foe. Be cautious, but master many creatures as you 
move through the Dungeon so your strength may increase. The stronger you become, 
the fewer hits it will take to destroy a creature. If you go to a deeper level 
without mastering most of the creatures on the levels above, your strength will 
be no match for the creatures you encounter. Eventually, if you survive, you 
will face the evil Wizard. Defeating the Wizard will be the ultimate struggle, 
for his strength is greater than all his creatures.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>BUT BE WARNED... long before you face the real 
Wizard, he will send a demon in his image to test your worthiness and resolve. 
Only after defeating the Wizard's image will the true challenge 
begin.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING!</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A name=Objects><FONT face=Arial size=3><B>Objects</B></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Within the Dungeon there will be a number of objects 
which must be used in your quest. The creatures will have collected most of the 
objects in the Dungeon by the time you arrive. There are six object 
classes:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>TORCH SWORD SHIELD FLASK SCROLL RING</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>There are several types within each of these object 
classes. For example, a TORCH can be a PINE TORCH or a LUNAR TORCH. The chart 
below will clarify the various types of objects. The types of RINGs, however, 
will not be listed in the chart. You must discover them yourself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>When you first enter the Dungeon, you will be given a 
backpack containing a PINE TORCH and a WOODEN SWORD. You can find other objects 
within the Dungeon and can get them when they are on the floor. At any time, you 
can see what objects are in your backpack and on the floor by typing 
EXAMINE.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>You can look at the Dungeon by typing LOOK (but only 
after an EXAMINE command).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>To grab something from your backpack, you must first 
have an empty hand. Then use the PULL command, as in PULL LEFT PINE TORCH. To 
place something you are holding into your backpack, type STOW LEFT (for left 
hand) or STOW RIGHT (for right hand). Your right or left hand is now empty and 
the object you are holding is in the backpack.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Creatures in the Dungeon are aware that objects are 
valuable and will gather objects they encounter as they move throughout the 
Dungeon. A creature will continue to carry the objects it has collected until it 
is destroyed. When a creature is destroyed, the objects (if any) will drop to 
the floor. The objects will remain where they fall, even if you leave the area, 
unless you pick them up or another creature comes by and picks them up. You can 
pick up an object from the floor using the GET command only if you have an empty 
hand (ex-ample: GET RIGHT SHIELD). You can drop an object to the floor from 
either hand by typing DROP LEFT or DROP RIGHT respectively. This leaves one hand 
empty, and the object you were holding now appears on the floor of the cell you 
occupy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Object Types</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>TORCH No rays of light penetrate the Dungeon. You 
will need the TORCH to find your way. When you first enter the Dungeon, you will 
see only darkness. If you want to see you must PULL the TORCH into either hand 
and light it by typing USE LEFT or USE RIGHT. You will hear the match strike, 
and the TORCH will be mounted on your backpack. Your hand is now empty, and you 
can see. If you EXAMINE your backpack, the TORCH currently in use is highlighted 
After an EXAMINE command you must LOOK to see the lit Dungeon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In time, all TORCHes burn down and eventually die. As 
this happens, you can see less and less in the Dungeon. The PINE TORCH lasts 
fifteen minutes. The LUNAR TORCH holds some magic light and will last for thirty 
minutes. The SOLAR TORCH is the most powerful and lasts for sixty 
minutes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>It is vital that you find another TORCH before your 
light goes out, or you will be in pitch darkness and at the mercy of the 
Wizard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SWORD The Dungeon is very dangerous. Only a fool 
would enter without holding close his best and sharpest SWORD. When facing a 
creature, you can attempt to strike him with a SWORD you are holding by typing 
ATTACK LEFT or ATTACK RIGHT, depending on which hand your SWORD is in. If 
you</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>miss, you hear the swish of your sword through the 
air. If you hit, you hear the blow strike and the command area shows!!! after 
the attack command to show that you have made contact.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stronger creatures are naturally harder to hit. You 
will also find that you miss more often as the light from your torch grows dim. 
It becomes even more important to find other torches before your light burns too 
low.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As you grow stronger (if you survive), the force and 
effect of your blows increase. But do not expect the creatures of the Dungeon to 
fall from a single blow. And beware... for even as you strike, they will strike 
back, often with fatal results.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SHIELD When you hold a SHIELD in your hand, you are 
protected from some of the force of an attacking creature's blow. This may save 
your life! The effectiveness of a SHIELD depends somewhat on your strength and 
the strength of the creature you are facing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>You can also ATTACK with a SHIELD. The MITHRIL SHIELD 
is quite powerful and can be used effectively as a weapon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Attacking with a SHIELD is better than attacking with 
an empty hand and makes a great noise. But BE CAREFUL.... jokesters tend to have 
very short careers in the Dungeon!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>FLASK In the Dungeon you might also find various 
magical FLASKs, which may serve you in your quest. If you are holding a FLASK 
and type USE LEFT or USE RIGHT (depending on which hand it is in), you will pour 
the contents of the FLASK down your throat. Be careful... flasks may harm you or 
greatly aid you. Their effects may be striking or subtle, short-lived or 
permanent.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>You may get a clue to the nature of a FLASK from its 
name when you are able to REVEAL it. But the only way to really learn the true 
effect of a FLASK is by trying it in different situations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>SCROLL It is said that in the Dungeon there are 
SCROLLs that may be of immeasurable value in conquering the Powers of Evil. To 
use a SCROLL you are holding, type USE LEFT or USE RIGHT.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>RING RINGs are extremely magical ! They can serve as 
weapons of great power, and can strike down mighty enemies in a twinkling. But 
now that they are under a powerful magic spell that prevents their use by mere 
mortals.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Learn how to unleash the power of a RING in the 
"Magic" section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Magic</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Dungeon is a magic place. Creatures, torches, 
weapons and certain doors in the Dungeon have magical powers. Creatures that are 
very magical (like the Wizard) are best fought with magic weapons and can only 
be seen fully under a TORCH that throws magical light. You must learn from the 
Dungeon as you proceed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>There is both Physical and Magical light in the 
Dungeon. The PINE TORCH, for example, radiates Physical light, so certain magic 
passages cannot be seen. Even though you cannot see these magic passages, you 
can move through them. So it will appear that you can step through the walls in 
some places. If you have magic light the passages will appear as triangles. 
Other passages will appear as rectangles and can be seen in any 
light.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As you proceed in the Dungeon, you must find more 
powerful magic torches to reveal the magic doors and creatures.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Reveal</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Objects in the Dungeon often have hidden natures that 
are not immediately known. To discover the full power of an object, you should 
always attempt to REVEAL it. To REVEAL an object, you must be holding it in 
either hand and type REVEAL RIGHT or REVEAL LEFT, respectively. For example, you 
may be holding a TORCH that can be REVEALed as a more powerful LUNAR TORCH. The 
more powerful an object, the more strength it takes to REVEAL it. If you are 
unable to REVEAL an object you have found, you should save it</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>in your backpack. After you have grown in wisdom and 
strength, try again to REVEAL it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Like other objects, the full powers of a SCROLL or a 
RING cannot be used until you have REVEALed them.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Incant</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Only RINGs can be INCANTed. Attacking with a RING 
(even after you have REVEALed it) won't have much more effect than a bare-handed 
slap. The RING will make its magical sound, but will hold no power until it has 
been INCANTed. You must use your wisdom to determine the magic name of a RING. 
Then you must INCANT the magic name to release the RING's awesome power. The 
type of RING that you may REVEAL serves as a clue to the magic name of the RING. 
For example, if a RING is found and REVEALed to be an IRON RING, a possible 
incantation is to type INCANT STEEL, and press [ENTER] If the incantation is 
correct, the RING transforms into a STEEL RING of great power. If the 
incantation is wrong (which it is!), nothing at all happens, and you are left to 
ponder the correct incantation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>After you have successfully INCANTed a RING, you can 
ATTACK using the RING as a magic weapon of great power. But use it wisely, for 
its power is not limitless, and use of a RING also puts a great strain on your 
heart. It is rumored that even the power of the evil Wizard is derived from a 
RING which he holds. If you manage to defeat the real Wizard, you must find the 
Wizard's RING, for it may hold the secret to your future. Remember ALL RINGs can 
be INCANTed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Your Heartbeat</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Throughout your adventure in the Dungeon, you see and 
hear your heart beating as you continue the journey. Many things affect your 
heart rate. Moving fast or with a heavy load, swinging a SWORD or wielding a 
RING, being attacked and struck by a creature . . all these and more will make 
your heart beat more rapidly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Time and rest, if you can find them, will bring your 
heart rate down. If you allow your heart rate to climb too high, you will faint. 
This stops you in your tracks, but alas, the creatures do not stop and will 
continue to track and attack you. If your heart rate climbs even further, your 
weary heart may simply burst, and you will have failed in your quest. The faster 
your heart is beating, the easier a creature's blow will kill you or cause you 
to faint. It is best to be rested before attempting to master a powerful 
creature. As you grow stronger, so will your heart, and activities which once 
would have killed you will become easy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Go then, with caution, and grow in 
strength.</FONT></P>

The Book, " said the Master, "you are now ready to brave the Dungeon. Keep The 
Book with you always and refer to it often, for it contains much that can help 
you. Reread it after traveling in the Dungeon for a time, and you will 
understand much that may previously have been unclear. Remember to discover the 
nature of objects by revealing them, and strive to master the riddles of the 
rings. Seek out more powerful torches to see the magic passages and magical 
creatures of the Dungeon. "Study the Dungeon as you venture forth, for there is 
much about it that I do nor know and cannot tell you. Learn its ways and the 
ways of the creatures. Study their habits and use the knowledge against them. It 
is sometimes better to strike and run to fight again than to stand and bravely

of the Dungeon. Be sure to keep your wits about you... you will surely need

<P><FONT face=Arial size=1><B>Saving and Reloading Games</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>By using a cassette recorder and the commands ZLOAD 
and ZSAVE, you can save the entire state of the game at any point and restart 
there at a later time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>Refer to the Tandy Color Basic Manual (Chapter 8) 
that came with your Color Computer for information on how to connect the tape 
recorder to</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>the computer and how to set the volume level. Be sure 
to follow the tips at the end of the chapter on how to make good recordings. To 
save your adventure at any point, have the cassette positioned on blank tape and 
have the volume set correctly. Then press the PLAY and RECORD buttons at the 
same time until they lock. Type ZSAVE "name" and press <U>E N T E R. </U>"Name" 
is the name you choose for the game you want to save. The quotation marks will 
not display on your screen as you type them, but they are necessary.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>After the game has been saved, the cassette stops 
moving. Press the STOP button. Do not leave the recorder in Play/Record mode, as 
this can damage the tape. You may then move the cassette forward with the FAST 
FORWARD button for a couple of seconds and be ready to save another game at a 
later time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>To load an adventure you have previously saved, 
rewind the cassette to the start of the saved game, and press the PLAY button. 
Then type ZLOAD "name" and press <U>E N T E R</U>, where "name" is the name you 
gave to that game.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>The tape then begins to move and load your saved 
game. If you saved and loaded correctly, you will find yourself back in the 
exact situation you were in when you saved the game. If there was a problem with 
the load (such as wrong name, wrong volume setting, or a faulty or unerased 
tape), the game simply starts over. We recommend using Tandy CCR-81 cassette 
recorder (or equivalent) for maximum reliability. It is best to note the tape 
counter setting at the beginning of each saved game and to leave a few seconds 
of blank tape between each saved game so that you can be sure you are positioned 
in front of the correct data (by checking the counter) when you attempt to 
reload.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>Be sure to save early and often to prevent losing a 
long game due to a power failure or other mishap. It is advisable to do two 
ZSAVEs in succession.</FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
