Thank you for downloading a sample issue of CFDM!

Enclosed are two DSK files for the CoCo 3 Emulator, plus a DSKINI.EXE 
program to create actual 5 1/4 floppies for a real CoCo 3.

ISSUE52M.DSK is the magazine side of the disk.  Just RUN"M" from inside
             the emulator, or RUN"M" from the RS-DOS prompt on the CoCo.
             Use the arrows and Enter/Return to view the entries.  Use
             CTRL-# to see pages of each article.  # can be 1, 2, or 3.

ISSUE52P.DSK is the program side of the disk, featuring all original art
             work, original programs, etc.  Many of the programs just need
             to be LOADed and RUN like any BASIC program.  A few are m/l
             and need to LOADMed and EXECed.  The magazine side of the disk
             will give you any special instructions.

As is, the two DSK files will work with the CoCo 3 Emulator.  If you have a
real CoCo 3, you will need two blank 5 1/4 disks, plus the correct drive on
your DOS machine.  Insert one blank disk.  On the PC, go to the directory
where the DSKINI.EXE and the DSK files are and type:

DSKINI B: ISSUE52M.DSK

This will create a disk containing the magazine side of CFDM.
Remove and label the disk.  Insert the other blank one, and type:

DSKINI B: ISSUE52P.DSK

This will create the program side of CFDM.

These disks will now work on a real CoCo 3 under RS-DOS or A-DOS.
