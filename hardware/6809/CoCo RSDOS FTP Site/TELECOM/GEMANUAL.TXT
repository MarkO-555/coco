Greg-E-Term (GE Term for short) is one of the most advanced and
flexible  smart  terminal  programs  available  for  the  Color
Computer's 1, 2, and 3.  It is a  full-featured  terminal  that
supports  XMODEM  and  ASCII  file  transfers  from/to the ter-
minal buffer.    Those  using  GE Term  with a  CoCo 3 have the
added  ability  to  use it's  built in 80X24  or  40X24 display
modes.  It is important  to note that the  same  Version 1.0 of
GE Term will work,  without modification, on any of the current
CoCo's.

All of your  most  wanted features  of a  terminal  package are
included in Greg-E-Term.  CoCo 1 and 2 users can choose between
51X24, 64X24, 85X24, or 32X24 hi-res screen modes.   When using
these screens, GE Term activates an input buffer, so you should
not loose characters in these modes.   The  normal 32X16 screen
with Tandy's "hidden" true lowercase mode can also be used with
the CoCo 3.  1200 baud is supported both  thru the  Tandy RS232
Pak,  OR  the serial port (bit banger),  on ALL versions of the
CoCo!   For CoCo  1  &  2 users,  GE Term also supports the PBJ
WordPack 2 and the Double 80 +, 80 column boards. All these and
many   additional  features  are  explained  in  the  following
chapters.

Yes, 1200 baud is supported through the serial port on all CoCo
machines.  However, due to the nature of the CoCo 1 and 2's bit
banger,  1200  with the serial port  will not work perfectly on
those machines.  We recommend you use the Tandy RS232 Pak.

GE Term  requires a  64K Color Computer 1, 2, 64K TDP-100, or a
128K CoCo 3  with at least one  disk drive and  Radio Shack DOS
1.0 or 1.1.   JDOS should be compatible, but we have not tested
it.

Greg-E-Term is  already set  for standard  communications right
after you EXECute the  program.   However,  there  are  several
functions in GE Term which you might like to permanetly change,
so  every time  you  use  the terminal,  changing  options  and
parameters  after  execution will not be  necessary.   This  is
accomplished  by  using  the  customizer program,   GETC10/BIN,
standing for GE Term Customize 1.0.  It is written in Assembly,
and can only be used  to customize GE Term 1.0.   I suggest you
try  using  the terminal  before  making a  special  customized
version of GE Term for yourself,  so you find which options you
use and  like  the  most.   The  options  you  are  allowed  to
configure/customize are:

    FUNCTIONS                   OPTIONS              STANDARD

 Baud rate               (300/600/1200)                 300

 Word Length             (7 or 8 bit-no parity)         7
 Parity                  (none/even/odd/mark/space)     none
 Backspace/rubout value  (127 or 8)                     8

    upper                                               10
    bottom                                              10

All  of  the  above  functions can  be easily modified with the
customizer program.   It's menu-driven and self explanitory.

Before ever using Greg-E-Term,  be sure to make a backup of the
original distribution  diskette  (with its support programs and
documentation).   Use  a copy as  your telecommunications disk.










GREG-E-TERM USER MANUAL  V1.0                            PAGE 5



When you're ready to  customize your  own Greg-E-Term,  all you
have to do is LOADM "GETC10/BIN" from the distribution disk and
EXEC it.  You will  be prompted  to enter  the  filename of the
original GE Term,  which should be GETERM/BIN.  After answering
all  questions,  you  can  save the new custom GETERM.

NEVER give  out  a copy of  your own customized GE Term,  since
the configurations may not work for other systems,  and you may
also have  confidential  password  information  stored  in your
Macro  section!   Give  out  only  the  original files included
on the distribution diskette.

                 Greg-E-Term Options Explained

Most functions of the configurable options are explained below.
They can all be set to your own  standard  with the  customizer
program:

Baud rate can be set for 300, 600, or 1200 baud.   The selected
rate will be used for either  the Serial port or the RS232 pak,
depending  on  which  you  have installed.   GE Term will auto-
matically use the RS232 pak if  you have one installed  in  the
multipak.

"Mask incoming lowercase"  is used to either allow lowercase to
be  displayed or change incoming lowercase  to uppercase.   The
option 'y'es to mask is useful for those  CoCo 1 users who like
the speed of  the 32X16 regular  mode but  not the reverse case
which is used to represent lowercase.  Note: even though lower-
case is set to be masked, the actual lowercase letters  will be
stored in the buffer,  not the  uppercase which is displayed on
the screen while online.

Duplex may be set to full,  half,  or echoplex.  Most BBS's and
the major  networks,  except GENIE which uses half duplex,  use
Full duplex.   Half  duplex can  be used if  you are talking to
another  CoCo terminal running  GE Term.   It  will  allow your
characters  to echo to  the screen  so you can  see what you're
typing.

Word length comes set at 7 bit, which is what most systems use.
An  exception  to this are TCBBS systems (TCBBS requires you to
use 8 bit-no parity).  8 bits is generally  used on  BBS's that
feature graphics.

Many systems  support prompted  ASCII uploading.   This  is the
method of ASCII uploading that GE Term uses.  In general, BBS's
use the greater than sign,  ">", as their upload prompt.   Just
enter  the  proper  character as  your upload  prompt.   If you
select  control-3  from the Communications mode,  GE Term  will
wait till such character  is received  before it sends the next
line.

With an original GE Term, the RS 232 pak will be selected auto-
matically if it is installed in the multipak.   However, if you
choose,  you may turn it off by hitting <CLEAR><R> while in the
Communication Mode.

VidTex screen codes are  used for VidTex systems such as Compu-
Serve.   It is primarily a set of codes  which allows  for fast
and easy positioning of the cursor.

Your GE Term buffer is  set to initially be closed.  Should you
want it to be  open upon  execution,  so all  received  text is
stored when going to the communications mode, you may choose to
have it open.   When the buffer is full,  it will automatically
close.







GREG-E-TERM USER MANUAL  V1.0                            PAGE 7



The speed at which an ASCII upload takes place  (how fast Greg-
E-Term will send the lines), can be adjusted.  Most systems can
receive an ASCII upload  at the rate which GETerm is originally
set to.   However, should you discover a need to slow down this
speed,  you can  use  the  customizer  program  to change it in
your own custom GE Term. 

Space for nine  pre-defined text strings  (macros)  of up to 30
characters each is provided in Greg-E-Term.   These  macros are
great for  storing your  most frequently used BBS numbers, your
name, passwords, and other text.  To send  a macro in  the com-
munications mode,  hit <CONTROL>-<SHIFT>-<MACRO #>.  Be sure to
first hit the CONTROL key, not the SHIFT key!

To remind you again:   be sure not to give copies of your cust-
omized GE Term to others!   Remember your macros are also saved
in the final custom binary GE Term  file.  It would be easy for
others to view your confidential info by doing this.

Several screen  modes are  provided  with Greg-E-Term.  You may
select to  automatically  use any of the  hi res  screens  upon
execution  rather than the standard 32X16.  Another option CoCo
3 users may use are the 80X24 or 40X24 displays.  If you choose
either of  these,  you can also  select the  foreground,  back-
ground, and text colors!

Several options are provided for printers and how to format the
printed buffer onto a page.  You can change the lines per page,
characters per line, word wrap on or off, stop after every page
(for those using single sheets of paper), baud rate, and upper/
lower/right/left margins.

Note:  All  customized  Greg-E-Term programs will be labeled as
"customized", on the booting screen.

Option number 1 on the  Main Menu will bring you to the GE Term
Communication Mode.  It is usually not necessary to change your
parameters  before going to  this section,  since GE Term comes
configured with the standard options.  They are:

300 baud,  Mask incoming lowercase-No,  full duplex, 7 bits, no
parity,  VidTex screen  codes-ON, Buffer-Closed.

A note to TCBBS system users.  TCBBS REQUIRES you to use 8 bit,
1 stop bit,  and no parity.   An easy way to use these settings
without going to the Set parameter section  (selection 6 on the
main menu) is to hit <Clear><W> (or for CoCo 3 users, <ALT><W>)
while in  the communication mode.   This will cause the prompt:

 Data bits:8
 Parity:NONE

to appear on your screen.  Hit it again and you will be back in
7 bits.  GE Term provides  several other Clear-Key functions as
described below.


               <CTRL> and <CLEAR> key functions

Anytime while in the Communication Mode,  you can get a list of
the Clear-key functions  by hitting <CLEAR> and <?> at the same
time.   The following list will be displayed:

 GETERM term mode help
 =====================
 (use CLEAR with the listed keys)
   B - Baud rate setting
   D - Duplex setting
   L - Lowercase mask toggle
   P - Parity setting
   R - RS232 PAK toggle ON/OFF
   U - Backspace value toggle
   V - Videotex codes on/off
   W - Word length toggle
   Q - Quick color inquiry
   CNTRL-?: Other Help menu

The above are all the available  functions that can be executed
with the CLEAR key,  and another character held simultaneously,
while in the communication mode.  

The <Down-arrow> key  is the  CONTROL (CTRL for short) key used
with  Greg-E-Term.   To get a  help  list of  the  "Control-key
functions",  which can be performed in the  Communication Mode,
hit the  <Down-arrow> and <?>  keys  at  the  same  time.   The
following will appear:









GREG-E-TERM USER MANUAL  V1.0                            PAGE 9



 Control key definitions:
 ========================
  1 - Receive XMODEM
  2 - Transmit XMODEM
  3 - Transmit ASCII
  4 - Toggle buffer open/closed
  5 - Display buffer status
  6 - Enter conference mode
  @ - Return to menu
 For CoCo 3's:
 CLEAR-F1: toggle foreground
 CLEAR-F2: toggle background
 CNTRL-F1: toggle border

 CLEAR-?: other help menu

A note to CoCo 3 users and those with the deluxe keyboards, the
<CLEAR> key and the <ALT> key function the same.  Likewise, the
<CTRL> key and the <Down-arrow>  function as the same "control-
key".  From now on when referencing the Control-key we will use
<CTRL>  (same as the <down-arrow> key) and when refering to the
CLEAR key (same as the <ALT> key),  we will use <CLEAR>.

For those with an  HJL keyboard,  F1 and F2 are the same as the
deluxe keyboard's  <ALT>  and  <CTRL>  keys,  and F3 and F4 are
equal to F1 and F2 of the deluxe keyboard.


While  in the Communication mode,  and hitting  <CLEAR><B>,  GE
Term will cycle through it's available baud  rates,  listing to
the screen at which rate it will currently operate.   This rate
will be  effective  for both the serial port and the RS232 pak.

Hitting <CLEAR><D> will change the duplex to either Full, Half,
or Echoplex.

Depressing  <CLEAR><L>  will toggle  the Lowercase Mask  on and
off.   When it's on,  you will not see any lowercase characters
on the screen display.  However, lowercase will still be stored
in the buffer (if open),  whenever the host is actually sending
lowercase.

A <CLEAR><P> will cycle  through the available parity settings.
Keep in mind that if <CLEAR><W> is hit to switch to 8 bit, this
parity setting will automatically become NONE.

If you have a  Radio Shack  RS232 pak  or a  TCBBS Host CommPak
installed  in  the  multipak,  Greg-E-Term  will  automatically
detect it,  and  use it instead  of the serial port.   However,
should you decide  to use the serial port,  just hit <CLEAR><R>
to toggle it off or back on.

Most systems (including CompuServe) consider a decimal value of
'8' as  a 'backspace' key.   GE Term  comes  configured to send








GREG-E-TERM USER MANUAL  V1.0                           PAGE 10



decimal 8 when you hit the <back-arrow> while in the Communica-
tion Mode.   However, systems such as DELPHI use what is called
a Rubout,  and is decimal 127.   So if you plan to call DELPHI,
hit  <CLEAR><U> till  the  BS (BackSpace) is toggled as 'RUBOUT
(127)'.  This will cause Greg-E-Term to send a decimal 127 when
you hit the <back-arrow>.

If your  VidTex  codes  were set to off,  and  you plan to call
CompuServe,   you   may  want   to  activate  them  by  hitting
<CLEAR><V>.  Press the two keys again to turn the codes off.

<CTRL><1>  will RECEIVE  an XMODEM file, when in the Communica-
tion mode, and <CTRL><2> will SEND an XMODEM file.   The buffer
is used to send from and receive to.

<CTRL><3>  sends an  ASCII  file to  a  system that provides an
upload  prompt.   If you have  not selected  the proper  upload
prompt  with  the  customizer  program,  or no  prompt  has yet
been selected,  you  must enter one  in the  parameter  section
(main menu selection 6).

On the normal 32X16 screens,  a closed buffer is indicated by a
solid block. When open, it will change to two different colors.
The top half,  black,  and the bottom,  white.    In the Hi-Res
modes and  the CoCo 3 80X24 and 40X24 modes, a closed buffer is
represented  with an  underline.    An  open  buffer is a solid
block.   To toggle the buffer open and closed while in the Comm
Mode, hit <CTRL><4>.

Choosing  <CTRL><5>  will give  you  your buffer status.   When
these keys  are pressed,  you will see something similar to the
below list:

 Buffer bytes free:40600
 Buffer bytes used:00000
 Xmodem blocks:00000

Depending on  whether or not  you have  anything  stored in the
buffer,  these  numbers  will  change.   This  is  an excellent
feature  which gives  you the ability to find  how many  Xmodem
blocks will be needed to send the entire buffer.  After Loading
a program or data  file you wish to send,  by going to the Comm
mode and hitting <CTRL><5> you can then tell the receiving user
how many Xmodem blocks he can expect to receive.

Greg-E-Term also has another excellent mode of operation.   The
Conference mode can  be entered by selecting <CTRL><6> from the
Communication mode.   This  is very  useful when talking in the
famous 'CB Simulator', 'COnference', or 'Party Lines', found on
the large  national  networks.   After entering this mode,  the
screen will appear normal,  until you type something.  Whatever
you type  will appear  on the  last  line of  the  screen,  and
receiving text  will be  displayed  above this last line.  This
helps  a great  deal in preventing  confusion  while using such

network features like CB.   When finished typing your sentance,
hitting <ENTER> will send the line to the host, with a Carriage
Return tagged on at  the end.   If you  wish  to send the  line
without the C/R, instead of pressing <ENTER> when ready to send
your line, hit <CLEAR> instead.

Control characters  are an  exception  to the above rule.   For
example,  if you hit  <CTRL><L>  to clear the  screen  (when in
CompuServe COnference sections or CB simulators),  that control
code  (along  with  ANY control  characters)  will be  sent out
IMMEDIATELY, causing your screen to clear then and there, with-
out waiting for you to hit <ENTER> or <CLEAR>.

A further note,  the <CTRL><4> option of the Communication Mode
to open/close the buffer will ALSO work in the CO mode.

There is a drawback to using the Conference Mode.  The line you
type and want  to send can not be any  longer  than the current
width of your screen.   For example, if you are using the stan-
dard 32X16 screens, only 32 characters can be typed and sent at
a time.   However, if you are in the 80 column CoCo 3 mode,  up
to 80 characters can be typed in and sent at a time.  Likewise,
if you are  in the 51 column Hi-Res mode,  51 characters can be
sent, and so forth.

For CoCo 3 owners,  a function to select the foreground,  back-
ground,  and border colors,  while in the 40X24 or 80X24 modes,
has been provided.   Greg-E-Term has these set at the following
CoCo 3 standards:

 Foreground: White
 Background: Black
 Border: Black

These have been  choosen so those using monochrome monitors can
have a clear  text screen  upon execution.   For  those  of you
using  RGB  monitors,  you  may want  to  change these  to your
favorite colors.   <CLEAR><F1>  cycles  the foreground  (actual
text colors)  through  all 64 colors.   <CLEAR><F2> toggles the
background,  and <CTRL><F1> the border.   When  you  find  your
favored colors,   I  recommend  you use  the customizer program
so these colors will automatically  be choosen when you execute
your  custom GE Term.   Else  you  will  have  to  page through
all those colors each time you execute the terminal.

You can find the decimal values of the current screen colors by
hitting  <CLEAR><Q>  while in the Communication Mode.  You will
be prompted for these numbers by the customizer program, if you
choose to redefine the standard color sets.

Note:  even though  two of the  screen  color option  keys  use
<CLEAR>,  they both appear in the <CTRL> online Help List Menu,
Under the "CoCo 3's" list.

         Additional keyboard text characters available

Still more Control-Key  functions  are available  which are not
listed in the help menu.   They allow you to send characters to
the host which  do not appear on the keyboard.   The list below
shows their functions:

 <DOWNARROW><SHIFT><,> - left brace
      <CTRL><SHIFT><.> - right brace
             <CTRL><,> - tilde
             <CTRL><.> - pointer
             <CTRL><:> - pipe
             <CTRL><;> - backslash
             <CTRL><-> - underline
      <CTRL><SHIFT><:> - left bracket
      <CTRL><SHIFT><-> - right bracket

Other special  characters you  can send  without the use of the
<CTRL> key, not shown on the keyboard, are listed below:

      <SHIFT><UPARROW> - underline
   <SHIFT><RIGHTARROW> - right bracket
        <SHIFT><BREAK> - ESCape
             <UPARROW> - Up arrow

Note:  In  order to send  a left  brace,  you MUST use the DOWN
ARROW key instead  of the CTRL  key  (for CoCo 3 users),  since
BASIC will produce a  <?>  (question mark)  when you hit (CTRL)
(SHIFT)(<).   That  question mark  will  be  interpreted  by GE
Term as a request to see  the Control Key Help  Menu  (which is
usually produced by hitting  <CTRL><?>).   And subsequently, if
you use  the  <CTRL> key  instead of the <DOWNARROW>,  the help
menu will be displayed.

The above extra characters will appear differently on different
GE Term text screens.   On the CoCo 3's 80X24,  40X24, or 32X16
CoCo 3 screen,  the characters will appear as you would expect,
with the  exception of the underline; while in the CoCo 3 32X16
mode, it will appear as a back-arrow.  In the normal 32X16 mode
the braces will appear as reverse character brackets, the tilde
will show as  a reverse character up-arrow,  the pointer as the
(@) symbol,  the pipe as a reverse character backslash, and the
underline as a back-arrow.  Unexpected results are expected for
any of the Hi-Res or the two 80X24 hardware board screen modes.
