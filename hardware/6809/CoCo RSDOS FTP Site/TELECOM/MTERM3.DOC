                               Main Menu Option 7
    
    
    

    Selecting this option will present you with a blank screen.  Simply type
    in any desired data or messages that you wish to send, a screenful at  a
    time.  To edit, just use the arrow keys to move the blue, nondestructive
    cursor anywhere that you wish on the screen.

    The  orange  blocks  that you'll see when you hit <ENTER> indicate where
    you have  "carriage  return"  characters  on  the  screen.   This  is  a
    convenience feature of MIKEYTERM, since it allows you to enter your text
    in lines of a certain length.

    The  Color  Computer displays lines 32 characters long, so you may enter
    lines up to 64 characters long, for example, by simply entering the data
    until  two  screen  lines  are almost full on your screen.  Pressing the
    <ENTER> at this point will terminate the line with  a  carriage  return,
    and  ensure  that  the  length of the line doesn't exceed 64 characters.
    Similarly, 80-character lines can be entered  by  pressing  the  <ENTER>
    after two and one-half lines or less have been entered.

    Some editors that are used on BBS's or CompuServe (in  particular)  will
    not  allow  lines  longer  than  a  certain  preset  limit, say 64 or 80
    characters.  MIKEYTERM, by displaying the carriage return  characters on
    the  screen  as  orange  blocks,  allows you to avoid the frustration of
    having to edit the contents of the buffer in order  to  deal  with  this
    problem.

    To put the screen in the buffer, just press the  <BREAK>.   Your  screen
    data  will  be appended to any existing data in the buffer, and then you
    will be returned to the Main Menu.
    
       NOTE:  Once the screen data has been moved to the buffer, it
              CANNOT be edited further by MIKEYTERM.  It is advisable
              to edit the text carefully BEFORE pressing the <BREAK>.

    If  you  desire,  you may enter more data into the buffer by re-entering
    BUFFER ENTRY mode.  The DISPLAY mode may be used to  view  or  print the
    buffer contents or portion thereof.

    If you wish to abort and return to the  Main  Menu  without  moving  any
    screen data to the buffer, then use <SHIFT>+<CLEAR>.

                               Main Menu Option 8
    
    
    

    This  menu  option will allow you to view or change some of the internal
    parameters used by MIKEYTERM.   Use  the  up  and  down  arrow  keys  to
    position  the  "->" marker on the line that contains the parameter to be
    changed.  Use the <ENTER> key to toggle the selected option  through its
    allowable  parameters.  When  the  parameter  reads  as desired, nothing
    further is required.  The options are then set as they are displayed.

    The  baud  rate for the printer may be set from this menu also.  Instead
    of entering a phone number, type an  "*"  followed  by  the  hexadecimal
    value  that  you would normally POKE into locations &H95 & &H96 (149 and
    150 in decimal).  Leading zeroes are not required but you many  use them
    if  you  choose.   If  more than 4 hexadecimal characacters are entered,
    only the last 4 are used.  To use MIKEYTERM with  a  1200  baud printer,
    for  example,  you  would  enter  "*0029" or just "*29".  (Don't use the
    quotes, of course.)  Naturally, the printer and  the  modem  may  not be
    used simultaneously, due to current hardware and software limitations of
    the Color Computer.

    The  <spacebar> will return you to Communications, while the <BREAK> key
    will return you to the Main Menu.
    
    

    Miscellaneous Notes:

    When 8-bit word length is  selected,  parity  is  automatically  set  to
    "NONE".  This is a requirement and may not be modified.

    When  half  duplex  is  selected,  "Linefeed  on  carriage  return"   is
    automatically  set  to  "YES".   This  is  the usual case for successful
    operation by your Color Computer, but may be changed to "no" if desired.
    Note  also  that  in half-duplex mode, the characters that you send from
    the keyboard will NOT be  stored  in  the  buffer  since  they  are  not
    received  from the serial interface.  (A half-duplex host doesn't "echo"
    the characters you send back to you, as a full-duplex host would.)

    Typing an "*" (asterisk) at the Main Menu will produce the prompt:
    
                              ARE YOU SURE ?  (Y)

    Any reply other than a 'Y' will return you to the Main Menu.  A 'Y' will
    reset all disk drive heads to track zero (if a disk system  is  in  use)
    and then initialize BASIC.

                              Going Online F-A-S-T
    
    
    

    Since MIKEYTERM is supplied pre-configured for successful operation with
    most BBS's and information services, there  really  isn't  a  reason  to
    avoid going online NOW!  It's EASY!

    First, just type in LOADM "<filename>": EXEC.   The  <filename>  is  the
    name  you've given to your customized version of MIKEYTERM if you've run
   the "CNFG47" program, or use "MTRM47" if you're  running  from  a  BACKUP
    copy of the distribution disk.

    After the program is loaded into your computer, you'll  see  MIKEYTERM's
    distinctive title screen displayed.  At this point, you'll probably just
    want to push the "1" to enter communications mode, unless  you  need  to
    alter some of the default settings.

    Don't worry about pressing the wrong keys.   If  you  happen  to  make a
    mistake,  the  <BREAK>  key  will  exit all modes except Communications,
    where you'll have to use either control-5 or -7.  If you  press  any key
    other  than  those  between  1-8  or  the  <*>  key,  you'll receive the
    "*-INVALID OPTION-*" message from MIKEYTERM.  In any  case,  you haven't
    harmed anything.

    Next, dial your favorite BBS or information service, (use the directions
    supplied  by  that  service)  and  await  the high-pitched tone from the
    distant modem.   When  you  hear  it,  just  put  your  modem  into  the
    "ORIGINATE"  position,  (see  your modem instructions for information if
    you need it) and you're ONLINE with the host!

    At  this point, you'll need to transmit either a control-C or an <ENTER>
    to get the ball rolling.  After that,  you've  successfully  entered the
    fascinating world of TELECOMPUTING!

    Have FUN!!

                   A Brief Description of the XMODEM Protocol
    
    
    

    The  following  description of XMODEM protocol is included as background
    information for the  technically  interested,  and  may  be  omitted  by
    others.

    XMODEM is an asynchronous, "receiver driven" file transfer protocol that
    is  configured  for  8  data  bits,  no  parity,  and one stop bit.  The
    protocol imposes no restrictions on  the  contents  of  the  data  being
    transmitted.   No  checks  are  performed  for control characters in the
    128-byte data blocks.  Absolutely any kind of data may be sent - binary,
    ASCII,  "compressed" BASIC, etc.  The protocol has not yet been formally
    adapted to a 7-bit environment for the transmission  of  ASCII-only  (or
    unpacked hex) data.

    XMODEM's popularity is due to the fact that it is an  "Error  Detecting,
    Error Correcting" protocol.  Transmission errors due to phone line noise
    or  other  electrical  disturbances  will  be  detected  and  the  block
    containing  the  error  will  be  retried  up  to  10  times.   After 10
    consecutive errors or "timeouts" the  transmission  is  aborted  with  a
    message indicating the reason.

    MIKEYTERM transmits only from the buffer.  By using a  buffer, MIKEYTERM
    eliminates  the  time-consuming  disk  access  time that's found in some
    other terminal programs.

    Once  the  protocol  is  put  into effect, the transmitter waits for the
    receiver to send an NAK character (ASCII 21).   Meanwhile,  the receiver
    sends  NAK  signals  every ten seconds.  Once the transmitter detects an
    NAK, it starts to send the file in sections of 128 bytes.

    Actually, more than 128 bytes are sent for each block.  At the beginning
    of the block is an SOH character  (ASCII  01),  followed  by  the  ASCII
    character representing the block number, followed by the ASCII character
    of the "one's complement" of the block number.  Then  the  128  bytes of
    the  file  are  sent.  Finally, the block concludes with a hex byte that
    represents the sum of the ASCII  values  of  the  128  bytes  sent  (the
    "checksum" character).

    A typical data block looks like this:
    
                 1-byte SOH ("Start of Header", or hex 1)
                 1-byte block number, starting with 1
                 1-byte complement of the block number (255-block #)
                 1 block of 128 bytes of data
                 1-byte checksum: The sum of the data bytes only,
                                  discarding any carry

    The  way  that file transfer proceeds is something like this:  since the
    protocol is "receiver driven", the sender waits for the receiver to send
    him  an  initial NAK ("negative acknowledgement", which is a hexadecimal
    15).  Then a block is sent and the sender waits for the receiver to send







   MIKEYTERM Users Manual               Version 4.7                  Page C-2



    either  a  NAK  or  an  ACK  ("positive  acknowledgement",  which  is  a
    hexadecimal 6).  The receiver checks the block to verify that everything
    is in order.  First it makes sure that the block  started  with  an SOH.
    Then  it  makes sure that the block number is correct.  Then it performs
    its own calculations on the 128 data bytes and compares its own checksum
    with the one received from the transmitter.

    If everything is in order, the receiver sends an  ACK  character  (ASCII
    06)  to  the  transmitter, indicating that the next block is to be sent.
    If the receiver can't verify, it sends an NAK, requesting that the block
    be  sent  again.   This continues, block by block, until the entire file
    has been sent and verified.

    At  the  end  of the file, the transmitter sends an EOT character (ASCII
    04).  The receiver acknowledges the EOT with an  ACK,  and  the transfer
    terminates.

    MIKEYTERM uses a few deviations from the XMODEM standard that permit the
    user  to transmit ASCII files freely.  This deviation, while not part of
    the original specification, is consistent with the recommendation of the
    author  of  the  XMODEM  protocol for purposes of adapting it to a 7-bit
    environment. 

    The differences are listed here in brief:

    1.  A  linefeed/carriage-return pair is inserted at the end of the data
        to be transmitted.  This ensures that the last data line ends with
        a carriage-return.

    2.  A  linefeed is inserted after each carriage-return if one does not
        already follow it in the buffer.

    3.  Blocks are padded with 127 blanks with a carriage return in
        the 128th position.  This ensures that the last block, if shorter
        than 128 bytes, will be terminated with a carriage-return.

    4.  The user will be prompted as to whether the file is in ASCII format
        when XMODEM TRANSMIT is selected.  (Control-3 while in
        Communications.)  Answer [Y] or [ENTER] if so, and Mikeyterm will
        handle the rest for you.  Binary files will be sent "as-is".
