The RS232 Pak  always  expects carrier to be present  (from the
modem) before anything will be sent from it.  Thus, most of you
should have a switch on your  modems to make the carrier always
"high";  in other  words,  make  the  carrier signal  always be
present.   This  is  needed  for  the  RS 232  pak  to  operate
correctly.  If you wish to use Greg-E-Term to dial with a smart
modem (ie. using "ATDT"), you MUST have the carrier high before
you can send anything through the RS232 pak  (such as the phone
number you wish to dial.)

If you do not have such a switch,  you must first manually call
the BBS or network with a phone,  and receive  a carrier before
anything you type in the Communication Mode will be sent to the
RS232 pak.

                 Notes on Xmodem File Transfer

Xmodem  protocol was originally  developed by Ward Christensen.
This protocol provides error-detection,  error-correction which
ensures an accurate transmission and receipt of files.  GE Term
follows the standard's  for Xmodem  set  by  Christensen,  with
modifications to  the timeout routines,  to allow for transfers
on slow systems such as CompuServe.

After a transfer is  finished,  you will be prompted with "File
Transfer Complete".   You can  then save the buffer contents to
disk in the correct format.

Hitting  <BREAK>  during  an  Xmodem  transfer  will  abort the
process at the end of the current block send.

At the end  of any  Xmodem Transfer,  the  GE Term  buffer will
automatically close.

Do not try  Marking portions  of your buffer  before saving any
Binary or Compressed BASIC programs.

Select  number  2  from the main menu  to view the buffer.  The
last line displayed will be:

 ENTER,BREAK,S,N,B,T,ARROWS?

This is to remind you:   hitting <ENTER> will page down through
the buffer,  one  screen length  (this will differ depending on
what screen mode you are using) at a time.  <BREAK> will return
you to  the  main menu.   You  can also  scroll up  or down the
buffer one line at a  time by using the up and down arrow keys.
A global  <S>earch has  also been  provided.   When viewing the
buffer, if you select <S>, you will be prompted with:

 Enter search string:

Just enter a  string that you  wish to search for, which may be
contained in the  buffer.   If Greg-E-Term  finds a match,  you
will be  returned to the buffer viewing,  and the first line on
the screen will  contain the search  string  you asked for.  To
find the next occurance of that string, just hit <N>. To search
for a new string, depress <S> again.

There is no way to edit the buffer before saving to disk.  Greg
feels these functions  are for word processors.   However,  you
CAN mark  portions of the  buffer  that you  would like  saved,
rather than saving the entire buffer.

For instance,  if you would  like to  save a list from an ASCII
saved BASIC program  (a file  that was  not saved in Compressed
BASIC format) that is in a portion of the buffer, these are the
steps you would take:

First,  use <2> from the main menu to view your buffer.   Then,
use the down-arrow key to  page down the buffer until the FIRST
line of the  BASIC program is on the TOP line  (the first line)
of your screen.   At this point,  hit <T>.  This will mark that
portion of the buffer  as being  the Top.   Next, use the arrow
key  again to page down the  buffer until the LAST  line of the
BASIC program just scrolls off the top of the screen.  Thus, if
you were to hit  the up-arrow once,  the LAST line of the BASIC
program would be displayed at the top of the screen.   But make
sure the LAST line of the program JUST  scrolls  off the screen
and is not visible.   Then hit <B> which  marks this portion of
the buffer as the Bottom.

Steps on  how to  save the  buffer are  explained later.  Note:
after Marking and saving one portion of the buffer,  you may go
back to view the buffer,  and  mark a new portion of the buffer
that you wish to save.

There is a way to type something into the buffer (although this
is not an official function),  if you have a need to type some-

thing in (such as a message) before going online, without using
a word processor, you can follow these steps.  First, go to the
Communication mode and use <CTRL><4> to open your buffer.  Then
use  <CLEAR><D> to set your duplex to half.   After that, what-
ever you type on the screen will be stored in the buffer.  Keep
in mind,  there is still no editing provided.   You can use the
backspace (back-arrow) to erase  something on the  current line
you are typing,  but after you hit <ENTER>,  you can do nothing
more  with  that line.   Also remember to close your buffer and
change the duplex to  the appropriate  settings  before calling
the host.

The data in the  buffer may be  saved to  disk as any file type
you choose.   When you wish to save the buffer to disk,  select
option 3 from the main menu.  You will then be prompted with:

 Buffer Save to Disk

 Filename==>

Enter the  filename here,  as you  would  when  saving  a BASIC
program to disk while in Disk BASIC.   For example, include the
filename,  extension,  and the drive number.   If you wanted to
save the buffer  with the filename  PROGRAM  and  the extension
BAS, on drive 1, at the above prompt you would enter:

 PROGRAM/BAS:1

If you do not enter a drive number, the default 0 will be used.

After entering the filename,  you will be asked in which format
you wish it to be saved:

 Save file as:
 1. Data File/ASCII BASIC
 2. Compressed BASIC
 3. Binary File
 CHOICE==>

If the file to save is a text file, or a BASIC program saved in
ASCII  format,  choose <1>.   When  receiving a  file  that was
actually in compressed BASIC form  (this is the format in which
BASIC programs are  normally saved to disk),  select <2>.   For
machine language Binary files, choose <3>.   By hitting <BREAK>
at this prompt, you can abort the save.

Before  the  actual  save  is  begun,  you  may  also be asked:

 Strip Linefeeds? (Y/N)

If you have  received an  ASCII file through Xmodem,  each line
may have  an extra linefeed,  especially  when downloading from
CompuServe.   Note: these  linefeeds  will not be  visible when
viewing the buffer.  If there were extra linefeeds sent, answer
'Y' at this prompt.  For most situations Stripping of linefeeds
is not needed, and should not be used.

After   the   above   prompt,   you   will   next   be   asked:

 Partial Save? (Y/N)

If you had previously Marked a portion of the buffer you wished
to save separately, you should answer 'Y'.  If you answer 'N'o,
the entire  buffer will  be saved even if you  had a portion of
the  buffer marked.   If you  had not  Marked  a portion of the
buffer,  and/or you  WANT the entire buffer saved,  simply  hit
<N>.

If you plan to send a text file,  program,  or other data file,
you must  first load it into  the buffer.   GE Term Version 1.0
does not support direct disk dumps;  all transfers are from the
buffer.   Note:  whenever you load the buffer, it will first be
automatically cleared.

After selecting <4> from the main menu, to load the buffer, you
will be prompted with:

 Buffer Load from Disk

 Filename==>

At the above prompt,  enter the filename  as it  appears in the
directory, in the same format as when saving the buffer.  Don't
forget to include  the extension.   Also be sure to include the
drive number if it's not on drive 0.

If the  file  loading  was saved  in ASCII format,  you will be
prompted with:

 File is ASCII
 Insert LF's? (Y/N)

If you plan to  upload the  ASCII file with  Xmodem  to systems
such  as  CompuServe,  it  may  be  necessary to answer 'Y' and
insert linefeeds.  Due to CompuServe's  structure,  if you have
not inserted an extra linefeed, the file  may  be  useless when
received at CompuServe.

By pressing <5> from the main menu,  the directory of any drive
may be displayed.  You will first be asked:

 Drive number:

Enter the appropriate number (0-3).   If there's a good disk in
the   specified   drive,   the  free  granules  will  first  be
displayed, followed by the filename and extension of each file,
in  column  format.   The wider  your display screen,  the more
columns will be used when viewing the directory.  The last line
will ask  you  to hit  enter to continue,  should there be more
files in the directory, than could be displayed on one screen.

It should  not be necessary  for you to  use selection number 6
(off the main menu),  for several reasons.   First, Greg-E-Term
comes preconfigured  with standard parameters that most systems
use,  as explained in the section,  "Going  online with Greg-E-
Term".  And you can even change these configurations permanetly
with the GETC10/BIN  program.   Second,  most of the parameters
can be easily  changed individually from the Communication Mode
with the  <CLEAR> and <CTRL> function keys.   However,  you may
need to enter this section to change the upload prompt.

After  hitting  <6>  from the main menu,  the screen will first
display:

 Greg-E-Term Parameters
 ----------------------
 (Hit <CLEAR> to leave as is)


 Baud Rate:

    1: 110 baud
    2: 300 baud
    3: 600 baud
    4: 1200 baud

 Choice==>

All of the selections  will have the option to "leave as is" by
hitting <CLEAR>.   But if you choose to change a setting,  just
type the proper key.   After making a choice, you will be asked
another parameter question,  and so forth,  until all have been
reset or left as is.

Explanations to the parameter settings can be found in the sec-
tion, "Greg-E-Term Options Explained".

The buffer will  automatically be cleared  before you receive a
file with Xmodem or Xon/Xoff  file transfer protocols.  It will
also be erased whenever you load a file from disk.   Should you
want to clear the buffer at any other time, just hit option <7>
from the main menu.   Before  GE Term  actually gets rid of the
buffer contents, it will ask:

 Clear the buffer

 Are you sure (Y/N) ?

Answer 'Y' or 'N' as prompted.

When selecting <8> from the main menu, you will be greeted with
the following menu:

 GETERM Printer dump options
 ===========================

   1. Lines per page:00066
   2. Characters per line:00080
   3. Word wrap:No
   4. Stop after every page:No
   5. Left margin:00010
   6. Right margin:00010
   7. Upper margin:00010
   8. Bottom margin:00010
   9. Baud Rate:00600
  (BREAK to exit, P to print)
 Choice==>

This is  pretty  self-explanitory,  but I  will  clarify  a few
things.   All these parameters can be changed at this menu,  or
set to another standard  with  the GETC10/BIN  customizer  pro-
gram.   Many of you will find that you may wish to set all your
margins to 0 instead  of our  standard  of 10.   Sometimes this
setting  (10) may mix up  your  received  text  when  printing.
Other times,  it will make things look  much neater.  Selection
<4> is useful for those  using single  sheets of paper and need
time to insert a  new  sheet  after  the  current  is  finished
printing.   The baud rate is set at 600,  but most printers can
handle at least 1200, or better yet 9600.

A note to TCBBS Sysops:   If you have the TCBBS CommPak instal-
led,   hitting  <H>  instead  of  <P>  will  print  through the
parallel printer  port  of the Commpak,  instead of through the
serial port.

This is  one  of  the  most  useful  features  Greg-E-Term  has
included.  It allows you to select from numerous different text
screen widths/modes, depending on which version of the CoCo you
own.  For CoCo 1 and 2 users, the following menu will appear on
your screen after choosing <9> from the main menu:

     Set screen mode

  1. 32 X 16 normal
  2. 51 X 24 HiRes
  3. 64 X 24 HiRes
  4. 64 X 24 HiRes
  5. PBJ WP 2 80 X 24
  6. 32 X 24 HiRes
  7. Double 80 + 80 X 24


 Choice==>

All of the above modes can be used on either the CoCo 1 or CoCo
2.   The HiRes  screens use a 1.5K input buffer so you will not
lose characters when using them.   These screens will appear to
move much slower than normal when at 1200 baud, due to the buf-
fering  and graphics  printing involved,  and  this  cannot  be
helped.

Due  to  the  slow  operation  of the  hi-res screen modes,  we
recommend you use the 32X16 screen when using 1200 baud, unless
you have the CoCo 3 or either of the two 80 column boards.

Both the  PBJ Word Pak 2  and  the  Double 80 +, 80 X 24 column
boards are supported.   However, if either of these is selected
while using  GE Term with a CoCo 3,  the results will be unpre-
dictable.   The terminal  will probably crash due to the incom-
patibility of these boards with the CoCo 3.

For those using a Color Computer 3, these additional menu items
will appear:

  8. CoCo 3 80 X 24
  9. CoCo 3 40 X 24
  0. CoCo 3 32 X 16

The above  use the  CoCo 3's  built-in  hi-res  displays.   The
regular, "hidden" 32 X 16 screen (with true lowercase) can also
be choosen.

We also recommend  you DO NOT  use the  HiRes  CoCo 1/2 screens
when running  GETERM on a CoCo 3  using the Serial port,  since
the speed  at  which  the  serial port  operates  on  the  3 is
slightly  different  than the  rate  of  the  CoCo 1 or 2 port.
Therefore,  the HiRes modes on a CoCo 3 may appear to be slower
than when using them on a CoCo 1/2.

Up to 9 predefined text strings, called Macro's, can be defined
with Greg-E-Term either by using option <M> from the main menu,
or by defining them in your own  custom  GETERM with  the  cus-
tomizer  program.   They  can be  30 characters in length each.
You can view  these or change  them by  selecting  <M> from the
main menu.  The following sub menu will then appear:

and await the new string.   In order  to permanately  save your
own macro's, it will be necessary for you to run the GETC10/BIN
program.   After doing this,  the next  time you  EXECute  your
custom  GE Term,  the  macros will  appear at  this  menu  when
viewing it.  Hitting <BREAK> will return you to the main menu.

                    GETERM Techincal Chapter
                    ========================


Darren asked  me to write  a small section of the GETERM manual
for him,  about GETERM's technical specifications.  Before I go
into the techinal specs, I am going to take this opportunity to
thank Darren  for his  unbelievable help with GETERM.   Without
Darren's help,  GETERM would never have reached the public,  as
it was originally  designed  for myself and  friends.   Thanks,
Darren!

GETERM isn't designed to be a hardware specific terminal.  What
I mean by this is that you don't HAVE to have an RS232 PAK,  or
a CoCo 3,  or a PBJ WordPak, etc.   BUT,  there is obviously no
way that I can allow for every seperate combination of features
that everyone would want in a terminal.  I do, however, welcome
suggestions and will consider each and every one of them.   For
those  people looking for  a CoCo 3 terminal,  sorry,  but this
isn't it.  Sure, it'll run on a CoCo 3, give you the 80 columns
and reliable  1200 baud operation,  but it ISN'T a CoCo 3 term-
inal.  I have my own ideas on a CoCo 3 terminal, and may under-
take them someday. 

GETERM has many  "indirect pointers"  at the beginning  of it's
code,  used  by  the  customizer  program  to  find  the  exact
addresses for specific functions.  They are listed below: 
 
  ADDRESS        NAME
 =====================================
    $E03        BUFFER POINTER
    $E05        CUSTOM POINTER
    $E07        PBJ PARMS POINTER
    $E09        TERMINAL PARM POINTER
    $E0B        SCREEN MODE POINTER
    $E0D        PRINTER PARM POINTER
    $E0F        MACROS POINTER
    $E11        COLOR BOOTUP LIST  

BUFFER POINTER:  This is  a 16 bit value that points to the end
of GETERM,  and the beginning of GETERM's buffer.   Taking this
value,  and subtracting  one will give  you the address  of the
last byte used by GETERM for programming. 

CUSTOM POINTER: This points to a 8 bit value that, when NZ (not
zero) will force a  "CUSTOMIZED COPY"  message at bootup.  This
is used  so  that  people  may distinguish  between  customized
copies and originals.   

PBJ PARMS POINTER:  This  points to a small list of PBJ parame-
ters used to  boot up the PBJ WordPak II.  Many people use dif-
ferent values on their WP's,  so this to allow "specialization"
for those who need it.

TERMINAL PARM POINTER:  This points  to a table,  in  which all
parameters that are "terminal" parameters are listed.   A table
follows:
 
     TPP+00: Buffer status: Z=closed, NZ=open
     TPP+01: Baud byte: 0123 for 110, 300, 600, 1200 bauds
     TPP+02: Mask lowercase: Z=don't mask, NZ=mask
     TPP+03: Duplex: 012 for FULL, HALF, ECHO
     TPP+04: Data Bits: Z=7 data bits w/ parity setting, NZ=8,
             No Parity
     TPP+05: Parity: 012345 for None, Even, Odd, Mark, Space
     TPP+06: Upload prompt: an ASCII character, or a NULL for
             no prompt
     TPP+07: VideoTex codes (ESC-value type): Z=don't use,
             NZ=use them
     TPP+08: Upload Delay time: 16 bit value of timing
     TPP+10: BS key value: Z=use an ASCII 8, NZ=use an ASCII
             127

SCREEN MODE POINTER:  This  points to  a byte that contains the
bootup screen mode.  A list of possible values follows:
 
     0 - 32 x 16, no lowercase - normal for CoCo 1/2's
     1 - 51 x 24, software generated
     2 - 64 x 24, software generated
     3 - 85 x 24, software generated
     4 - PBJ Word Pak II (It is for ONLY the Word Pak II!)
     5 - 32 x 24, software generated
     6 - Double 80 + 80 column board
     7 - CoCo 3's 80 x 24 mode
     8 - CoCo 3's 40 x 24 mode
     9 - CoCo 3's 32 x 16 text mode, but with lowercase
         (similar to 0) 

Do NOT,  I repeat, do NOT try and use type's 7-9 unless you own
a CoCo 3.  They obviously will NOT work! 

PRINTER PARM POINTER:  Points to a table of printer parameters.
A list follows:
 
     PPT+0: Number of lines per page
     PPT+1: Left margin
     PPT+2: Right margin
     PPT+3: Upper margin
     PPT+4: Bottom margin
     PPT+5: Stop after every page (z=no, nz=yes)
     PPT+6: Word wrap lines (z=no, nz=yes)
     PPT+7: characters per line
     PPT+8: 16 bit value used internally by GETERM.  DO NOT
            CHANGE
    PPT+10: 16 bit baud rate (eg: 600 for 600 baud- not the
            232 constant)

MACROS POINTER:  Points to a  table made up of 9 enteries of 32
characters apiece.   Each  Macro  ends  with a NULL,  and  a CR
before the null is optional.

COLOR BOOTUP LIST:  This  points  to a  small  table  of  color
bootup parameters used by GETERM.  A small table follows:

(note: these are for CoCo 3 users ONLY)

     CBL+0: Foreground color (0-63)
     CBL+1: Background color (0-63)
     CBL+2: Border color (0-63)




GETERM will  also  respond  to a series  of codes  following an
ESCape (ASCII 27).   Some of these  codes are used regularly by
CIS and other host's.   A list of  what GETERM  will respond to
follows: 

       CODE VALUE                    USE
       (in ASCII!)
    
 ==============================================================
     (all codes begin with an ESC)
         A                   Move cursor up one line
         B                   Move cursor down one line
         C                   Move cursor right one character
         D                   Move cursor left one character
         H                   Home cursor
         J                   Clear to end of screen
         j                   Clear screen, home cursor
         Y (row+32) (col+32) Position cursor at ROW and COLUMN
         I                   Interrogate.  GETERM responds:
                             "GETERM 1.0"
         (next codes all begin with ESC EOT and then the ASCII)
         (note that an EOT is an ASCII 04)
         I                   Interrogate: returns current
                             screen mode
         P (palette#) (color)Set the a specific palette with a
                             color
         A (attribute)       Set the current printing attribute
         S (mode)            Set's a screen mode (returns an
                             ACK)
         R (C or R)          Set's the bootup palettes
         B (color)           Set's the border color
         D                   Forces 8 N 1
         C                   Returns a 0 for Coco 1/2, NZ for
                             CoCo 3 in use  

     Notes:

 -   ESC-EOT-I Will return 0-9.  The same values are used as in
     the SCREEN MODE POINTER option.
 -   ESC-EOT-A (attribute) The Attribute bits are: bit7=blink,
     bit6=underline, 543=background color, 210=foreground
     color.

 -   ESC-EOT-S (mode) uses the SCREEN MODE POINTER values for
     setting a screen mode.  When it is done, it will send an
     ACK (ASCII 06).  Wait for this ACK before sending any
     data.
 -   ESC-EOT-R (C or R) Will reset the palette registers to
     BASIC's defaults.  The C or R stands for COMPOSITE or
     RGB.  
 -   ESC-EOT-B (color)  Color is 0-63.
 -   ESC-Y (row+32) (col+32) The row and column values have
     ASCII 32 added to them, to keep them within ASCII range. 
     To set the cursor at, say, column 10, row 5, you'd send:
     27 89 37 42 (all in ASCII, decimal)

Please, keep in mind that this was not desgined as a comprehen-
sive  description of these codes,  but rather a list of what it
will respond to.   If you  require more  information  on  these
codes, let me know, and I'll provide it.

A few people  have  expressed  the need for  VT100 support.   I
agree,  and if I can find a  local host  computer that supports
VT100,  I will gladly  add  it  (for the CoCo 3 ONLY)!   Unfor-
tunately, I cannot afford to pay the GEnie, CIS or Delphi bills
for testing of  VT100 support,  so must rely on finding a local
computer.

I  am  available  for   questions   and   comments   on   GEnie
(GREG.MILLER),  Delphi (GREGMILLER),  and CIS (72057,1031).   I
am, however,  most easily reached on TCBBS-HQ at (201)-725-5028
300/1200 baud.  Leave a message to "GREG MILLER".

Anyone  wishing a copy of the distribution diskette (which con-
tains all Greg-E-Term files including all documentation)  AND a
printed copy of the User Manual may send $10.00 to:

 Greg Miller

Have fun.
