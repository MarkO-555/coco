There's been talk about interlaced graphics for the CoCo on coco.listserv
lately.  I promised I would put up a program that actually DID it, and here
it is!

ITERM.BIN is an old version of Twilight Terminal that was put together
specifically as an experiment in interlaced graphics.  It runs in 640x450
graphics mode in 4 colors.  The 4 colors are all shades of green and used
in such a way as to anti-alias the font graphics to keep them from
flickering and to increase their apparent resolution to about 1280x450 !

This program needs 512k, RGB, and a Tandy or Disto RS-232 card to run.
The interlace mode also seems to only kick in when used on a CoCo with the
OLD (1986?1985?) version of the GIME chip.  On the newer (1987) GIME chip,
the interlace doesn't seem to kick in, at least not with this particular
way of achieving it.  This doesn't mean the new GIME can't DO it, it's just
that you have to think of another way of doing it.
