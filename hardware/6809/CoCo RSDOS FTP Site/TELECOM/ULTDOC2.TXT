            NOTE: F3 and F4 are SHIFT-F1 and SHIFT-F2 respectively           If you  have no idea what the VT-Keypad is for, keep it off (make     sure the "%" isn't on the top line by pressing [ALT]-[Q]).            Saving all the default options          ------------------------------           At this point you have just set all the options you need set upon     each loading  of Ultimaterm.   Next  step is to save all these default     options to  disk.  This can be accomplished by pressing [ALT]-[D] from     terminal mode  to pull  up the  "Disk Commands" menu and then pressing     [F1] to  save all  the parameters  to disk.  If you're wondering where     the parameters are being saved, they take up two sectors on the disk -     Track 17,  Sector 17  and Track 17, Sector 18 - hidden behind the disk     directory in two unused RSDOS sectors.           I'll discuss  all the  features on the "Disk Commands" menu a bit     later in  the manual.   For now, you're free to roam around Ultimaterm     and use  the rest  of the  manual as  a reference  should you need any     further explanation on any commands.                                  Ultimaterm Commands                                 -------------------           When you  load up  Ultimaterm, you'll  find yourself  in terminal     mode.   To pop  up one of the many windows that allow you some control     over Ultimaterm,  simply push  the [ALT]  key with  one other key.  In     order to  see what  all the [ALT] key combinations are, press [ALT] in     conjunction with  the  [/]  and  a  command  summary  window  will  be     displayed on  your screen.   Actually, this is just one of two command     summary windows  which are  displayed.   To  see  the  second  command     summary window, press any key other than [BREAK].       [ALT]-[@]  Credits           I alone  can not  take credit for what Ultimaterm V4.0 has become     over the  past 3  months.  In an effort to list some of the people who     have made significant contributions to Ultimaterm V4.0, I have created     this credit section.           Fred McDonald  has kept  me in  touch with Delphi so that I could     see what people wanted from Ultimaterm V4.0.           Rex Hebert  provided me  with the  source for  a CRC  calculation     which I  used in  V3.0.   While making  every attempt  to improve upon     various subroutines which I considered too slow in Ultimaterm, I wrote     a new  CRC calculator  from the original which I'll provide further on     in the manual.                                         9                  Laverne Kelly  has become  my official  voice to keep me in touch     with Delphi officials and has also done much beta-testing to make sure     V4.0 will stand bug-free for a long time.           Jeff Mercer  sent me  a complete  list of  VT52 and VT100 control     codes which  made it  possible to write support for these two terminal     emulations.           Guy Loucks  provided me  with the VT52 and VT100 keyboard control     sequences and  also helped me test the VT emulators out on his account     on a local VAX.           Dan Damron was the first to lay eyes on Ultimaterm and spent much     of his own time helping me prepare this manual.            I received  many, many letters over that last three months (a few     even had donations!) of people who were impressed with Ultimaterm V3.0     and previous versions and asked for many of the features now available     in Ultimaterm  V4.0.  Without all this support, I don't think I'd have     put as  much effort into bringing you version 4.0 as I have.  Now that     4.0 is  complete, I  will take  the  time  to  respond  to  all  those     letters!?       [ALT]-[A]  Autodial           This is  the section everyone has been asking for (well, everyone     with a  smart modem that is).  This section replaces both the Autodial     and Redial found in V3.0 with a complete and proper dialing directory.           If you're  not sure what a dialing directory is, simply put; it's     a list  of System  Names, phone  numbers, and terminal parameters that     allows you  to select  a specific system to call and have the terminal     program automatically  set the  parameters for  that system and redial     until that  system is  online.  (whew!).  Anyone vaguely familiar with     terminal   programs like  Telix or  Procomm on  the IBM will know that     we've been lacking a very useful feature for too long.                              Creating a dialing directory           The first  thing  that  happens  when  you  select  ALT-[A]  from     terminal mode is Ultimaterm looks for the dialing directory in memory.     If found, it will display the directory and allow you to enter or dial     various systems.   If  not in  memory, Ultimaterm looks on the current     disk to  see if  the dialing  directory is present (under the filename     "ULTDIAL.DIR").   If not,  it checks  to see if there's enough room on     the disk  for the dialing directory (at least 2 granules) and asks you     if you want to create the directory to that disk.                                          10                  When the  directory is  finally loaded  into memory,  it will  be     displayed on the screen as follows:           System Name (30chrs)                 Phone  W P S   Baud    Term          ========================= ================  = = =  =====  ======            .          (15 entries per screen * 3 screens)            .          ========================  ================  = = =  =====  ======            The list  of possible  keypresses will  be  displayed  along  the     bottom (too  wide to  display here,  but I'll  explain  'em!)  and  an     inverted bar will be placed at the top of the entries on the screen.                                     Cursor Movement           You can  move the inverted bar up and down through the entries on     screen by using the up and down arrow keys.  To move through the three     possible screens  that can  contain fifteen  entries each, use [SHIFT]     with the up and down arrow keys.                               Adding or Changing an entry           Move the inverted bar to the place you'd like to add or change an     entry by using the cursor keys.  Then press [C] to start changing that     entry.  The first window that pops up asks you to enter in the "System     Name".   If you're  changing an  entry, you  can just press [ENTER] to     leave the system name unchanged.           The next  window that  pops up asks you to enter the phone number     for the  system.   Just type  in the  phone number and NOT any dialing     commands (like ATDT).  If you're changing an entry, you can just press     [ENTER] to leave the phone number unchanged.           The next  window asks  for the  word length,  7 or 8 bits.  Press     [ENTER] to leave it unchanged.           The next window asks for parity - None, Odd, Even, Mark or Space.     Again, press [ENTER] to leave it unchanged.           The next  window asks  for stop  bits - 1 or 2.  As always, press     [ENTER] to leave it unchanged.           The next  window asks  for baud  rate.   Select the baud rate you     call that system at or press [ENTER] to leave unchanged.                                            11                  The last  window asks  for the  terminal emulator you want to use     when you  call the  system.   Again, select  the  emulation  or  press     [ENTER] to leave unchanged.           You will  then be  taken back  to the dialing directory screen in     which the  entry you  just created  or changed  will be displayed.  At     this point,  go ahead  and  start  adding  entries  into  the  dialing     directory.   The entries  do not  have to be sequential in the list so     you can  use one  screen for  certain types of systems, another screen     for other  types of  systems, or  like I  do; a  screen to  hold voice     numbers of friends.           When the  dialing directory  is complete  (or any  time you  make     changes) you  should use  the "[S]-Save  Directory" option to save the     directory to disk (under the filename "ULTDIAL.DIR").  Should you wish     to list  the directory  to your  printer, you  can use  the "[P]-Print     Directory" option  which prints all fourty-five possible entries; even     if they're blank.           Before you  can dial  entries, you  should first  set the dialing     prefix [^P]  and dialing suffix [^S].  Just so you understand what the     dialing 'fixes  are, possible  dialing prefixes  for Hayes compatibles     would be "ATDT" or "ATDP 9," while a possible dialing suffix for Hayes     compatibles would  be "[ENTER]".   To  slow down  the sending  of  the     dialing string  to the  modem, simply  start the dialing prefix with a     [^B] and a 1/4 second pause will be performed between each character.           The next  thing that  needs to  be done  before an  entry can  be     dialed successfully  is the  setting of  the dialing directory options     ([O]-Options).  Pressing [O] will display the following screen:                                Dialing  Options                         Dial time     : 020 seconds                        Hang-up time  : 002 seconds                        hang-up String: ue+++uuATH0<cr>                        Abort String  : <cr>                         Connect string: CONNECT                        Busy strings  : BUSY                                      : NO CARRIER                                      : NO ANSWER                                      : ERROR                         carrier Method: String            A bit  of explanation  is in order for the "Dialing Options".  To     make it  possible for  Ultimaterm V4.0  to work  with almost any smart     modem, I  had to  make Ultimaterm  a little  smart itself.  Most smart     modems send  messages to  the terminal  so that  you can  see what the     modem detects  on the  phone line,  whether it be a busy signal, or no     dialtone, etc.   Ultimaterm  V4.0 will  send the dialing prefix to the     modem followed  by the  phone number  selected (with no spaces, unless                                      12             you include  them in  the number  or dialing  'fixes) and finished off     with the  dialing suffix.   It  then has  to assume  that the modem is     dialing the  number and  will alert  Ultimaterm to the modem's status.     If Ultimaterm  receives no  response from the modem for the set length     of the  dialing time,  it will  send the  abort string  to hang-up the     modem and  then dial  the phone number again.  If a connection is made     and the  modem responds  with the  connect string  or puts  DCD on the     RS232 pak low, Ultimaterm makes some noise and drops to terminal mode.           The "Dial  time" can  be changed  by pressing [D] and typing in a     new time.  "Dial time" is how long Ultimaterm will wait for a response     from the  modem before  attempting the  dial again.   If  you're going     through many switchboards (i.e., long distance calls) you can lengthen     the dial  time.   If you're  calling a  local number  that rings right     away, you  might choose  to shorten  the dial  time  to  get  in  more     autodial attempts  (and therefore  a better  chance at  being the next     caller on the system).           The "Hang-up time" can be changed by pressing [H] and typing in a     new time.   "Hang-up time" is the length of time to wait after sending     the abort  string and before attempting to dial again.  This is useful     for making  sure the  modem is  ready to  accept  the  dialing  string     (preventing half the string from being ignored by the modem).           The "hang-up  String" is  actually used  by the  ALT-[H] while in     terminal mode and not by the dialing directory.  The reason I chose to     place the  hang-up string  here is  these options  are  modem-specific     options, while  "Modem Options" are general settings.  I use a hang-up     string of  "[^A][^B]+++[^A][^A]ATH0 [ENTER]"  which sends a one-second     pause (^A),  sets the  rest of  the string  to be  sent at  1/4 second     intervals (^B), sends +++ which returns my modem to the command state,     pauses for  2 seconds  (^A^A) to give the modem a chance to catch it's     breath, and  finally sends  the hang-up  command ATH0  followed  by  a     carriage return (^M).           The "Abort  string" is  the string  that is  sent  to  abort  the     current dial  attempt and  prepare for  the next  attempt.   On  Hayes     compatibles, one  simply pushes  [ENTER] or  [SPACE] and  the  dialing     command is  immediately aborted and the modem returned back to command     mode.  I use a hang-up string of just one carriage return (^M).           The "Connect  string" is  used to identify the response the modem     gives to  indicate it  has connected  to the  system being dialed.  On     Hayes compatibles,  "CONNECT" will cover "CONNECT 300", "CONNECT 1200"     and "CONNECT 2400".           The "Busy  strings" are  used to identify the responses the modem     gives to indicate it cannot make a connection and a redial should take     place.   I've squeezed  room for  four possible  busy strings  such as     "BUSY", "NO CARRIER", "NO ANSWER" and "ERROR".                                          13                  "carrier Method" is used to decide the best way to recognize that     a successful  connection has  been made.  If set to "String", then the     "Connect string"  and "Busy  strings" will be used in autodialing.  If     set to  "DCD", then  the CD  status of the RS232 pak will be monitored     until a connection has been made.  DCD is by far the most reliable but     will only  work if  you have an RS232 pak AND DCD on your modem is set     to active (or normal).           When all  the "Dialing  Options" are set to work with your modem,     you can  use the  "Default  Option  Save"  available  from  the  "Disk     Commands" window (ALT-[D] from terminal mode) to permanently save them     to disk.                                   Dialing a number           There are  two ways  to dial a number from the dialing directory.     You can select [M]anual dial whereby you get to enter the phone number     you wish  to dial (basically for a once-only dial) or press [ENTER] or     [SPACE] to dial the inverted entry.           When  the   dialing  process   starts,  you  will  be  shown  the     "Autodialer" window which is basically for your own entertainment.  It     displays the  number being  dialed, the  number  of  times  it's  been     redialed, the countdown to the next dialing attempt, and the status of     the last  attempt.   The "Autodialer"  window also  allows  you  quick     changing of both the "Dial time" and the "Hang-up time" to quickly and     easily adjust the autodialer to the fastest possible dialing attempts.     The window  also allows you to manually abort the current dial attempt     and try again, to abort the dial attempt and exit from the dial window     or to  just exit from the dial window while leaving the number dialing     away.  The "Autodialer" window looks like this:                                   Autodialer                         Dialing     : 242-3515                        Attempt #   : 15                        Countdown   : 005 seconds                        Last attempt: Not connected                         [D]ial time : 020 seconds                        [H]ang-up   : 002 seconds                         [SPACE] to restart                        [ENTER] to exit                        [BREAK] to abort and exit            The phone  number following "Dialing" will be displayed one digit     at a time as the digit gets sent to the modem.  The "Attempt #" counts     down from  the "Dial  time" to  zero, at which time it sends the abort     string and  redials the number; printing the words "Not connected" for     the "Last  attempt".   If you're  using the  connect and busy strings,     then "Last  attempt" will  also  display  "BUSY"  or  "NO  ANSWER"  or     whatever busy string was received by the modem.                                      14                  Before an  autodial is started, the parameters for that selection     are set and then initialized.  If you have a switch on your modem that     manually selects  300 or  1200 baud,  you must  set that switch to the     baud rate you choose to call the system at before you can autodial the     number.       [ALT]-[B]  Buffer Commands           Buffer Commands  gives you  minimal control  over  a  few  buffer     functions.  Pressing [ALT]-[B] will give you the following menu:                                Buffer  Commands                          C               Clear Buffer                         D             Display Buffer                         P               Print Buffer                         S              Buffer Status           "Clear Buffer"  simply resets all the buffer end pointers so that     the buffer  is cleared  and ready  for taking in new text or receiving     new files across the modem.           "Display Buffer"  simply dumps  the contents  of the  buffer in a     straight list.   You  can pause  the display  by pressing  any key and     abort it by pressing [BREAK].           "Print Buffer"  does the same as "Display Buffer" but directs the     contents to the printer.           "Buffer Status"  shows you  how much  memory is used, how much is     free, how  many disk  granules it will require to save the contents of     the buffer  and how many Xmodem and Ymodem blocks it will take to send     the buffer.       [ALT]-[C]  Conference Mode           Sometimes known  as "Chat  Mode",  Ultimaterm's  conference  mode     allows separate  entry of  text from  the received  text so  that many     people can  hold a  conference without  incoming text  splitting apart     text you're trying to type.           When you press [ALT]-[C] the Conference Mode window pops up which     asks you  how many lines you want to use for your personal text entry.     Remember that  the more  lines you  allocate for  yourself, the  fewer     there will  be to  view received  text on.   You  might want  to limit     yourself to  using one  or two  lines at  the most  just to ensure you     don't babble on!                                           15                  After you select how many lines you would like for the conference     mode, the screen will clear and a bar will split the lines you have to     type in  text (on  the bottom  of the  screen)  with  the  lines  that     received text  will appear  in.   Each section of the screen will have     it's own cursor.  If you wish to capture the incoming text in your own     buffer, press  [ALT]-[T] to  open the  buffer.   The cursor in the top     section will turn from an underscore to a box and a "*" will appear on     the top status line.           While  in   conference  mode  all  [ALT]-[key]  options  will  be     available to you with the exception of [ALT]-[A] (autodial), [ALT]-[C]     (conference)  and   [ALT]-[Q]  (VT  Keypad  toggle).    To  exit  from     conference mode, simple press [BREAK].       [ALT]-[D]  Disk Commands           Disk Commands provides you with a bit of control over disk files.     Pressing [ALT]-[D] will bring up the following window:                                 Disk  Commands                          L   Load from disk to buffer                         S        Save buffer to disk                         D                  Directory                         K                  Kill File                         F             Format Ramdisk                         R          Backup to Ramdisk                         B           Backup to Floppy                         F1       Default Option Save                         F2       Default Option Load           "Load from disk to buffer" allows you to load any RSDOS file from     an RSDOS  disk into  Ultimaterm's buffer.  You can then send that file     using one of the transfer methods.           If the file being loaded is in ASCII format, you will be asked if     you want to add linefeeds to the file while it's being loaded.  If you     answer yes,  then any  linefeeds in  the file  will be ignored and any     carriage returns in the file will be complemented with a linefeed.           "Save buffer to disk" allows you to save any file you've received     (or loaded)  into the  buffer to  an RSDOS  formatted disk.   When you     select save  you will first be asked for the filename to save the file     under and  then asked  for the  file type.   The  file  types  are  as     follows:           File type                   appear as          ------------------------    ---------          ASCII File                    1 A XX          BASIC ASCII File              0 A XX          BASIC Binary File             1 B XX          Machine Language File         2 B XX          Text Editor Source File       3 A XX                                      16                  If the  file saved is an ASCII File, and it is too long to fit on     the current  disk, you will be asked if you would like a multiple save     performed.  In a multiple save, the file is saved as much as can be on     the current  disk and then you will be prompted to insert another disk     to continue saving the file (under the same name) on.           If the  file saved is any other type and it is too long to fit on     the current  disk, you will be told the file will not fit and the save     will be halted.           If the file saved is an ASCII File, you will be asked if you want     to strip linefeeds during the save.  If you reply yes, then any time a     linefeed is encountered in the file, it will be ignored and won't make     it to the file on disk.           If the  filename you  wish to  save under  already exists  on the     disk, you  will be  told so  and asked  if you  want to  save the file     anyway.            "Directory" simply  allows you  to take  a directory of the RSDOS     disk or  ramdrive (if  512K is  present).   It will  also display  the     number of granules that are free.           "Kill File"  allows you  to kill  a file  on the  RSDOS  disk  or     ramdrive (if  512K is  present).   It is  the same as the KILL command     under RSDOS.           "Format Ramdisk"  allows you to erase the contents of the ramdisk     giving you 68 granules free.           "Backup to  Ramdisk" allows  you to  BACKUP from  a floppy to the     ramdisk to  make file  transfers go much faster.  Of course, this will     only work if 512K is present.           "Backup to  Floppy" allows  you to  do just  the opposite  of the     previous.  The disk you want to backup onto must be formatted in RSDOS     or an error will occur.           "Default Option  Save" allows  you to  save  all  the  changeable     parameters of  Ultimaterm onto  disk.   The parameters  are saved onto     track 17,  sectors 17  and 18 where they are out of the way of regular     RSDOS operation.           "Default Option  Load" allows  you to  load  all  the  changeable     parameters of  Ultimaterm from  disk.   Although these  parameters are     loaded upon  the initial execution of Ultimaterm, you may have changed     a few  of the  parameters and  would like  to load the originals back.     For this reason, I've provided "Default Option Load".                                           17             [ALT]-[E]  Exit           This command  allows you  a clean  exit back to RSDOS to save you     the trouble  of pressing  [ALT]-[CTRL]-[RESET] or  turning your Coco 3     off and on.  When you select EXIT, the ROMS are copied back to RAM and     the reset vector is called to perform a warm start.       [ALT]-[F]  Freeze Screen           For those  of you  who hate  watching text  scroll by you at 2400     baud with  no means of stopping it temporarily, I've provided a screen     freeze command  that will  halt screen  display while still giving you     all the [ALT]-[commands] at your fingertips.  To enable text-to-screen     again, simply press any key other than one of the [ALT]-[commands].           ** NOTE **  Only 3K of text will be buffered.  When the buffer is     full it  will start  to write  over the  text that  has  already  been     received.       [ALT]-[H]  Hang-up Modem           This command  will try  to hang-up  the modem in one of two ways.     If you  have an  RS232 pak,  the first  thing that  the modem tries is     dropping DTR  for a second and then raising it again.  If a connection     is still present, it tries the second method.            The second method is the only method tried if you don't have the     RS232 pak.   The hang-up string (changeable from the Autodial Options)     is sent to the modem.           If none  of these work, you can always unplug your modem from the     wall or turn it off?!       [ALT]-[I]  Freeware Information           This is  the section  that asks  you to send me a donation for my     efforts in  bringing you  Ultimaterm.  Please remember that Ultimaterm     is Freeware  which means  you are  under no  obligation to support any     future efforts I might decide to bring to the CoCo 3 world...           If you  do decide  to send  some money,  I will  send you  back a     licensed copy  of Ultimaterm  with a  printed copy  of the manual.  If     anyone should  send a  donation to  me and says they got it from "such     and such"'s  serialized copy (please include the serial number) then I     will send them back 10% of your donation.           ** NOTE  **   The only  copy of  Ultimaterm that  will appear  on     Delphi or  CIS or  any other major network will be '000000' to be fair     to everyone else who has donated.                                        18             [ALT]-[K]  Keyclick toggle           Keyclick is  simply a sound that is generated each time you press     a key  on the  keyboard that the computer picks up (in case you didn't     know!).   I find  it very useful myself while others find it annoying.     You can toggle keyclick on and off by pressing [ALT]-[K].       [ALT]-[M]  Monochrome/Composite toggle           Not everyone is blessed with an RGB monitor of any brand.  If you     are using  a television  or  monochrome  monitor,  [ALT]-[M]  will  be     especially of  interest to  you.   This command  toggles  the  display     between black  on white  and shades.   When  in "black  on white", the     colorburst will  be disabled  to make  an even clearer picture on a TV     set.       [ALT]-[O]  Set Options           Please refer  to the  beginning of this manual so I don't have to     type this section in all over..!       [ALT]-[P]  Print Screen           This does  a straight  dump of the screen to an 80 column printer     so that  you can  forever keep  a copy  of the  current display on the     screen.   If the printer is not ready, the screen dump will be aborted     so as  Ultimaterm doesn't  sit around  waiting for  a printer  to come     online.   If you have to, use [ALT]-[F] to freeze the screen while you     get your printer ready.       [ALT]-[Q]  VT Keypad Toggle           For all you people who use your terminal program on a VAX network     of any kind, Ultimaterm will not only support screen controls sent out     by these  systems, but  will also do it's best to emulate the keyboard     of one.   When  [ALT]-[Q] is  turned on, you will see a "%" on the top     status line  and some keys will be reassigned new values.  They are as     follows:                               VT-100 or ANSI emulation           Key            New Assignment        Transmitted codes          -------------  --------------        -----------------          Shift @        Home cursor           (1B5B48)          Up arrow       Cursor up             (1B5B41)          Down arrow     Cursor down           (1B5B42)          Right arrow    Cursor right          (1B5B43)          Left arrow     Cursor left           (1B5B44)          CLEAR          Clear screen          (1B5B481B5B324A)          Shift ENTER    Erase to end of line  (1B5B4B)                                      19                                           VT-52 emulation           Key            New Assignment        Transmitted codes          -------------  --------------        -----------------          Shift @        Home cursor           (1B48)          Up arrow       Cursor up             (1B41)          Down arrow     Cursor down           (1B42)          Right arrow    Cursor right          (1B43)          Left arrow     Cursor left           (1B44)          CLEAR          Clear screen          (1B481B4A)          Shift ENTER    Erase to end of line  (1B4B)           If in  VT-100 emulation and the host asks for application control     functions, then  Ultimaterm will  change all  the "1B5B"  sequences in     cursor movements to "1B4F".           If you're  not familiar  with what I mean by "Transmitted codes",     all I'm  saying is that when you press a key (e.g., CLEAR under VT52),     the  codes  1B  (ESCape)  48  ("H")  1B  (ESCape)  4A  ("J")  will  be     transmitted across the modem.       [ALT]-[S]  Buffer checksum           This command  adds together  the 8-bit values of the bytes in the     buffer and  comes out with an 8-bit checksum value.  The only real use     for this  is to check a file after it's been received to make sure the     receiver got  the file  properly.   Since Xmodem and Ymodem have their     own error  detection and  correction processes,  this command's  value     will lie in ASCII transfers.           The larger the file is, the longer you'll have to wait to be told     the calculation of the CRC.      [ALT]-[T]  Buffer Toggle           Any incoming  text can  be stored  in the  text buffer for future     saving to  disk or  transmission.   To open or close the buffer, press     [ALT]-[T].  When the buffer is open, the cursor will change to a block     and an  "*" will  appear on  the top  status line.   When  closed, the     cursor will appear as an underscore.       [ALT]-[V]  Ultimaterm Version           This is just a single window that serves no other purpose than to     display the version of Ultimaterm that you are using.                                             20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
