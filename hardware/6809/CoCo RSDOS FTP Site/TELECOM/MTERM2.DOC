                                Using the Buffer
    

    All  routines that output from the buffer (tape, disk, printer, transmit
    buffer, and XMODEM transmit) will use the start and end marks.   Reading
    a  file  into  the buffer will automatically set the start and end marks
    for that file.  However, if the buffer is marked later, these marks will
    be honored instead.

    For example:  A disk file is loaded into the buffer  for  upload.  It is
    desired  to  leave the buffer open because a record of the session is to
    be saved or printed.  This is permitted  with  MIKEYTERM.   The incoming
    data  will  simply  be  appended to the end of the existing file in your
    buffer.

    The  best  part  is  that  the  end  mark won't be altered.  It is still
    positioned to mark the end of the file that was loaded.   When  the time
    comes to transmit or upload, only the file that was loaded will be sent,
    and nothing more.

    Whenever  you  exit  Communications mode, MIKEYTERM remembers all of the
    parameters that you set, things  like  whether  word  wrap  was  on/off,
    whether  the  buffer was opened or closed, your ENTIRE screen and cursor
    position, etc.  When re-entering Communications, all of these parameters
    will be restored, just as if you'd never left.

    When in combat with the "Auto Halt" feature turned  ON,  (assuming  that
    the  host  supports XON/XOFF protocol) the act of leaving Communications
    will issue a control-S to the host  so  that  while  the  user  is  away
    scanning  the  buffer  (or  any  other  function)  the  host  won't send
    anything.  Upon returning to Communications mode, MIKEYTERM will  send a
    control-Q  to  restart the host's transmission.  That way if any traffic
    was pending, it will be sent at that time.  It is even possible  to exit
    right  in  the  middle  of  a  line,  if  necessary.   When returning to
    Communications, conditions will be restored to normal, just  as  if  the
    exit had never occurred.  (It's a good idea to leave this feature OFF if
    in doubt about your host.)
    
    
                          What Is Saved In The Buffer
    

    Received  data that is to be saved in the buffer will be appended to any
    existing buffer data.  Please  refer  to  the  section  on  "Marking the
    Buffer" for further details.

    When in 7-bit mode, all data received from the RS-232 interface will  go
    into the buffer except:
                
                Linefeeds  (Hex 0A)
                Control-R  (Hex 12)   (Open  buffer)
                Control-T  (Hex 14)   (Close buffer)
                Null       (Hex 00)
                Rubout     (Hex 7F)

    When in 8-BIT mode, everything received from the RS-232 port is saved in
    the buffer if it is open.  Data sent from the keyboard is  not  saved in
    the buffer in Communications mode.

    The  Display  mode is provided in order that users may view the contents
    of the buffer.  The following commands are supported by MIKEYTERM:
    

    <T>op                 Move to the top of the buffer
    

    <B>ottom              Move to the bottom of the buffer
    

    <Down-arrow>          Move down one line
    

    <Up-arrow>            Move up one line
    

    <SHIFT>+<down-arrow>  Move down a full screen
    

    <SHIFT>+<up-arrow>    Move up 12 lines
    

    <P>rint               Print the  contents of the buffer.  If  a
                          portion  of  the buffer has been  marked,
                          then  only  that portion will be printed.
    

    <BREAK>               Return to MIKEYTERM's Main Menu.   If you
                          are  printing, the <BREAK> will abort the
                          print operation  and redisplay the screen
                          from which printing was initiated.
    

    <spacebar>                 Return      to      Communications      mode.

    <F>ind                Find  a  character  string in the buffer.
                          You  will  be  prompted  for  a   "search
                          string".   Type in  the  string  for  the
                          search and hit <ENTER>.  Use upper and/or
                          lower case as required.   The buffer will
                          then be scanned  for the first occurrence
                          of the search string.
    
                          When  found,    a  full  screen  will  be
                          displayed   beginning  with  the   search
                          string.   If  the  search string  is  not
                          found,  the  screen from which the search
                          was  initiated will  then be redisplayed.
    

    <N>ext                Find the next  occurrence  of the  search
                          string  defined  previously  with the "F"
                          function.   If another  occurrence of the
                          string cannot be found,  then the current
                          screen will be re-displayed.
    
    
                   Marking the Buffer for Saving or Printing
    

    To mark a portion of the buffer, the Display mode must first be selected
    from the Main Menu.  You may mark any portion of the  buffer  for output
    to  disk,  tape,  or  printer.   While  there are no restrictions on the
    nature of the data that can be marked, saving marked portions of  binary
    data  (such  as  M/L  programs or compressed BASIC programs) may produce
    undesirable and/or unpredictable results.   The  user  is  urged  to use
    caution.

    Here's how to mark the buffer.  Put the first line of the  start  of the
    portion  you  wish to save on the screen somewhere using the up and down
    arrow keys.  (Use the <SHIFT> also, if necessary.)  Push <M> for "MARK".
    A  blue  cursor will appear at the upper left-hand corner of the screen.
    Position the cursor at the START of the  line  of  the  portion  of  the
    buffer  that  you  want  to  save,  then push <S> for "START".  The blue
    cursor will then disappear and you'll hear a tone to inform you that the
    mark was made. 

    Now the end mark.  Use the up and down arrow keys (and  the  <SHIFT>, if
    you choose) to put the last line of the chosen area on the screen.  Push
    <M> for mark.  The blue cursor will be visible  again.   Place  it UNDER
    the  last  line  of the portion that you wish to save, then push <E> for
    "END".  The cursor will disappear and again you'll hear a tone to inform
    you that the end point is now marked also.

    NOTES:  You may mark EITHER the starting point or the ending point first
            for the portion to be saved.











   MIKEYTERM Users Manual               Version 4.7                  Page 16



    Generally,  it's  best to mark the buffer ONLY if it contains pure ASCII
    data.  Attempting to mark the start and/or end  points  of  binary files
    (such  as M/L or compressed BASIC) is an approximation at best, and will
    usually cause unpredictable and/or disastrous results!

    Anytime  you push <M> for mark, the "word wrap" feature will be disabled
    and the screen will be "unwrapped".  This means  that  the  lines within
    the  buffer  will  "break"  at the right side of the screen, rather than
    being formatted for 32 characters per line.  (This is necessary in order
    to  let  you  mark  the buffer accurately.)  Don't let this concern you,
    because all of your default parameters (including "word wrap")  will  be
    restored  when  you  return to Communications.  In the meantime, you may
    turn the "word wrap" function on and off (while you're in display  mode)
    by pressing the <W>.

    Now that the buffer has been marked, you may save the marked portion  of
    the  buffer  to  disk  or tape, print it, or transmit it.  All functions
    that output from the buffer (tape, disk, printer,  or  transmit  buffer)
    use  the  start  and end marks.  If you never mark the buffer, the marks
    will remain the same as the LOGICAL start and end of your buffer.   This
    means  that  if you load a file into the buffer, the start and end marks
    will be adjusted to reflect the true  start and end points  of  the file
    that  you just loaded.  The file may then be saved, printed, (if approp-
    riate) or transmitted.

    However, if you sign-on to your favorite BBS, even with the buffer open,
    YOU MUST MARK THE BUFFER before saving, printing,  or  transmitting  any
    portion of the buffer.  If in doubt, it's ALWAYS best to mark the buffer
    manually.

                               Main Menu Option 3
    
    
    

    This option is primarily designed to support the Radio Shack  Modem  II.
    MIKEYTERM  will  program the Modem II to dial a phone number using "slow
    rotary" dialing.  A 3 to 11 digit phone number may be  set  at  any time
    using Main Menu Option 8.  (Change parms)

    Those wishing to use the Hayes  SmartModem  may  enter  the  appropriate
    command  string into the buffer using the "Buffer Entry" option from the
    Main Menu.
    
        Example:  To dial a number using the Hayes' "TouchTone"
                  method, use Main Menu Option 7 (Buffer Entry)
                  to enter the string "AT DT 237-8113 <ENTER>" into
                  the buffer in order to dial the local phone
                  number of 237-8113.  (Without quotes, of course.)

    After  entering Communications, a control-9 will send the command string
    to the SmartModem.

    A  more  reasonable  alternative  is  the use of the "CNFG47" program to
    define one of the function keys with the required command string,  which
    can then be used to send the string to the Hayes SmartModems.

    Choosing <4> at the Main  Menu  will  allow  the  entire  buffer  to  be
    cleared.  This action will make available the full buffer capacity.

    You will be asked to verify that you REALLY want to  erase  the  buffer.
    Anything  besides  a  "Y"  will  abort  the  operation.   The  buffer is
    automatically cleared before loading files from disk or tape.

    The  amount  of  used  and  free  buffer space is displayed (in decimal)
    whenever the Main Menu is selected.

                               Main Menu Option 5
    
    
    

    This portion of MIKEYTERM is provided for those who  wish  to  use  tape
    I/O.  It is menu-driven for simplicity of operation.

    MIKEYTERM will read most common tape files into  the  buffer,  and  will
    write  files  to tape in either ASCII or binary format.  The buffer will
    be automatically cleared before the file is loaded.

    It's usually convenient to position the tape to be read at the beginning
    of the file  However, loading of a cassette file  may  begin practically
    anywhere on the tape because a general purpose routine is used to locate
    the start of the file.

    To  use the tape utility portion of MIKEYTERM, hit <5> at the Main Menu.
    You'll be asked if you want to:
    
        [1]  Read a tape into MIKEYTERM's buffer, or
        [2]  Write the buffer (or a marked portion) to tape. 

    Choose  whichever option is appropriate.  <BREAK> will return you to the
    Main Menu.

    If writing the buffer to tape, you'll be prompted for the file type:
    
        [1]  ASCII, or
        [2]  Binary

    Again choose whichever type is appropriate to  your  situation.  If  you
    choose  [2],  you'll be given the opportunity to supply the starting and
    execute addresses (in hexadecimal) that will be written to  tape.   This
    is  necessary  because  MIKEYTERM has no way of knowing this information
    following a file transfer.  If you merely  press  <ENTER>,  binary files
    written  to  cassette will be given start and execute addresses of zero.
    (The user should use whatever offset is  appropriate  when  loading  the
    tape from BASIC.)

    You'll then be prompted to prepare your cassette machine.   Hit  <ENTER>
    whenever you're ready.

    MIKEYTERM writes "gapped" files to  tape.   The  starting  and  stopping
    motion  that  you may notice from your cassette recorder is normal while
    MIKEYTERM is writing the buffer to tape.

                               Main Menu Option 6
    
    
    

    The disk utility portion of MIKEYTERM is also menu-driven  in  order  to
    make  it  friendly  and easy to use, as well as to provide the user with
    good error recovery and descriptive messages.  It was provided  to allow
    MIKEYTERM's  users to read files from disk into the buffer, save to disk
    from the buffer, and obtain disk directory  displays.   All  drives  are
    supported.

    A directory display (in two-column format) can be obtained  by  entering
    the drive number in response to the "FILENAME?" prompt.  Free disk space
    is also indicated.   After  the  directory  is  displayed,  you  will be
    re-prompted for the filename.

    There are no restrictions on the filename as long as you  use  at  least
    two characters.  (One character entries are interpreted as drive numbers
    for  purposes  of  obtaining  directory  displays.)  Use  upper   and/or
    lowercase characters as appropriate.

    The default extension is TXT.   If  a  blank  extension  is  desired for
    reading  or  writing a file, use a "/" after the filename followed by an
    <ENTER> at the "FILENAME?" prompt.

        Example: TESTFILE/<ENTER>  or  TESTFILE/:1<ENTER>

    A drive number may be appended to the filename if a drive other than the
    current  default  drive  is  to  be used.  It must be separated from the
    extension with a colon.

        Example: TESTFILE/TXT:1<ENTER>

    The data in the buffer (or a marked portion) may be written to  disk  as
    any file type you choose.  When a disk file is read into the buffer, the
    file type is displayed.  Note that the buffer  is  automatically cleared
    before loading a file.

    Rewriting an existing disk file is  permitted  by  MIKEYTERM.   However,
    you'll  be  notified that the file already exists, and asked if you want
    to overwrite it.  If you respond with a  "Y",  the  file  will  be over-
    written.  Any other response will abort the operation.

    The <BREAK> key will abort any operation except actual disk  I/O.   When
    in doubt, use it and start over.

                        Disk and Tape File Compatability
    
    
    

    Only  ASCII  files  can be freely transferred from tape to disk and vice
    versa.  However, transfer of any file  type  from  disk  to  disk  is no
    problem with MIKEYTERM.

    The following file types are supported when saving the buffer  to  disk.
    They   are   menu-selectable  from  within  MIKEYTERM's  "Disk  Utility"
    function.
    
                     (1)  BASIC program / ASCII format
                     (2)  BASIC program / Compressed (binary) format
                     (3)  Machine language program
                     (4)  Data / ASCII
                     (5)  Data / Binary

    You  may  save  the data in your buffer (or any portion of it) in ANY of
    the above formats.  No checks are ever performed on the contents  of the
    buffer regarding data type.  This makes it possible to transmit any type
    of disk file to another user of MIKEYTERM as long as the sender loads it
    from  disk  and the receiver saves it on disk as the same file type that
    the sender transmitted.

    Machine  language  programs  loaded  from disk will have their start and
    execute addresses preserved, as well as  the  file  length.   Compressed
    BASIC programs will also function normally.

    This also makes it possible to save your buffer data as  something  that
    it  is  not.   For  example,  you  may  save ASCII data files as machine
    language programs if you wish.  MIKEYTERM will be able to  read  it, but
    BASIC may not.

    NOTE:  These features of MIKEYTERM are extremely flexible, and the user
           is cautioned to exercise due care in their use.

                            A Caution For Tape Users
    

    Because of differing file types, disk files in M/L format  will  require
    conversion  to  CoCo  tape  format  before they may be saved to tape.  A
    utility program, TAPCNV, is supplied on the distribution disk  for  this
    purpose.

    Specifically, M/L programs known to have been submitted IN  DISK  FORMAT
    to  CompuServe  or  BBS's  will require conversion before being saved to
    tape in a usable form.  This is due to a  basic  incompatibility between
    the two file types, (disk versus tape) and is NOT a consequence of using
    MIKEYTERM and/or XMODEM.

    Simply  type  CLOADM  "TAPCNV":EXEC  and  follow  the program prompts to
    convert any  M/L tape  files  that  you've  downloaded  into  the proper
    format for tape systems.
