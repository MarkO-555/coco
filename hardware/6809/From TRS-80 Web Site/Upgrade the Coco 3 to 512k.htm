            <HR>
            As of this writing (February, 1993), the CoCo 3 has long been 
            orphaned, and support for it is now nearly non-existant. As part of 
            this situation, it has become impossible to buy 512K memory upgrade 
            boards for the CoCo 3. Well, if you have a 128K CoCo 3 and want to 
            upgrade it to 512K, it still is possible to do this without a 512K 
            memory board. The good news about this approach is that all that is 
            needed are 16 41256 DRAM chips and four .1 mfd to .47 mfd miniature 
            capacitors, and four 18 pin DIP headers. The BAD news is that this 
            approach is very tedious, and requires considerably skill and 
            experience with find soldering, and a lot of patience.
            <P>Materials:
            <P>16 41256 (256K x 1) DRAM chips These should preferably be 150 or 
            120 ns acess speed, although faster chips (100 ns or faster) will 
            likely work just fine, too.
            <P>4 18 pin DIP headers, of a size that will plug into the four 18 
            pin memory sockets on the CoCo 3. A Machine Pin style 18 pin socket 
            may work fine for this purpose. Machine Pin style 20 pin sockets 
            can, of course, be hack-sawed into 18 pin sockets.
            <P>4 .1 to .47 mfd (I recommend .33 or .47 mfd) capacitors, 
            physically very small in size (the size of a match-head is best).
            <P>One short piece of wire.
            <P><B>Approach:</B>
            <P>What you will do is make four QUADRUPLY STACKED sets of memory 
            chips. That is, you will be making four, four-chip-high piggybacks 
            on top of the four 18 pin headers. Most of the pins will go straight 
            thru and be soldered to the pins of the chip or header below them. 
            However, a few pins will be re- routed.
            <P>Bend straight out (horizontally) pins 1,2, and 14 of a 41256 DRAM 
            chip. Bend pin 16 of that DRAM chip "forward" so it reaches just a 
            bit outward in the direction of the length of the 41256 chip.
            <P>Line up the chip over the 18 pin header, so that pins 1 and 16 of 
            the DRAM chip lie over pins 2 and 17 of the header. See to it that 
            pin 16 of the 41256 is bent in such a way that it can make contact 
            with pin 18 of the header.
            <P>Solder pins 3,4,5,6,7, and 9 of the DRAM chip to pins 4,5,6,7,8, 
            and 9 of the header. These pins will be going STRAIGHT DOWN, unbent.
            <P>Solder pins 9,10,11,12,13, and pin 15 of the DRAM chip to pins 
            10,11,12,13,14, and pin 16 of the 18 pin header. These pins will be 
            going straight down.
            <P>Solder pin 16 of the DRAM chip to pin 18 of the header. This 
            requires that pin 16 be bent a bit "forward", as noted above. You 
            might want to put a "dog leg" type bend in it to keep it from 
            contacting pin 17 of the header.
            <P>Prepare three more 41256 chips in a similar fashion, EXCEPT don't 
            bend forward or out pin 1 or 16. Leave pin 16 alone. Now stack those 
            three chips on top of the chip and header you prepared, one on top 
            of the other. Attach pin 1 of the chips to pin 1 of the lowest chip, 
            and attach pin 16 of the chips to pin 16 of the chip below it. Note 
            that all the pin 16's are routed to pin 18 of the header, and that 
            all the pin 1's are routed to the pin 1 of the lowest chip, which in 
            turn is NOT hooked to the header, but instead is bent out.
            <P>Now, using wire wrap or other small gauge wire, join on each chip 
            pins 2 and 14. Run wires from the joined pins 2 and 14 of each 
            individual chip to pins 2,3,15, and 17 of the 18 pin header. It does 
            not matter what pair of joined pins goes to what pin of the 
            header... just be sure that each of those four header pins is 
            connected to a pair of joined pins 2 and 14 from one of the four 
            DRAMs in the stack.
            <P>Now solder on top of the stack the little capacitor, hooking one 
            side of the capacitor to pin 8 of the DRAM chip and the other side 
            to pin 16 of the DRAM chip at the top of the stack.
            <P>Make up a total of four such stacks as above.
            <P>Note that you will likely find it easiest to clip off the narrow 
            part of the horizontally bent out pins, leaving just the fat part of 
            them to solder to. This may in fact be necessary to keep the pins 
            from hitting each other when the stacks are installed.
            <P>Now plug each of the four stacks into the four 18 pin DRAM 
            sockets in the CoCo 3.
            <P>Solder short wire jumpers between the joined pin 1's of each of 
            the four stacks.
            <P>Solder a wire from the joined pin 1's of all 16 DRAMs to a plate 
            thru solde r pad just in FRONT of pin 11 of CN4 on the CoCo 3 mother 
            board. This is the missing address line used in the 512K upgrade.
            <P>The plate thru pad in question is located very near CN4, between 
            CN4 and CN 2 CN 4 is a 12 pin socket used for part of the 512K 
            memory board, and CN 2 is th e socket for the keyboard of the CoCo 
            3. Be SURE to remove the keyboard of the CoCo 3 before doing this, 
            else you risk destroying the ribbon cable of the keyboard when you 
            try to solder to the CoCo 3 mother board.
            <P>Your CoCo will look a bit weird, as if there are four "high rise 
            towers" in the memory chip sockets. However, if you carefully follow 
            these instructions, you SHOULD get out of this a 512K CoCo 3.

</PRE>What is going on here is that the Din and Dout of each 41256 
            is connected t o each other, and those two joined pins are then 
            connected to one of the bidirectional I/O lines of the header. The 
            one extra address line (pin 1 of a ll 16 chips) is hooked to the 
            mother board so that it can connect to that address line of the GIME 
            chip's memory management section. Finally, pin 1 of the 4464 chips 
            is not actually used, for it is an enable line that is grounded all 
            the time. Therefore, we can ignore the fact that the 41256 lacks 
            such a line.
            <P>It is a great pity we could NOT use four 44256 chips to upgrade 
            the CoCo 3 to 512K memory. This would have eliminated the hassel of 
            staking chips four high . However, the refresh cycle for 44256 chips 
            is 512 cycles, and the durn GIME ch ip in the CoCo supports only 256 
            cycle refresh. One would need special extra circuitry (like that on 
            the Disto 2 meg upgrade) to use such chips.
            <P>I have successfully upgraded one CoCo 3 to 512K in this fashion. 
            It's AWFULLY tedious.

            <P>P.S. minor typo: pin 14 of the 41256 is a Dout, not a "Din" line. 
            All Din lines of a given 41256 chip are shorted to the Dout line of 
            that chip in the CoCo 3 memory circuit. </FONT></P></TD>
