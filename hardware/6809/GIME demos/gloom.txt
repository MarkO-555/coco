GLOOM.BIN

This program is simply an example.

There has been talk on the CoCo listserver about 'Doom' for the CoCo, and
most people's impression was that it was completely impossible.  It was my
opinion that is WAS possible, though it wouldn't be as fast or as graphically
complex as the PC version.

I don't have the time to make a game, but I did manage to scrape up a little
demonstration of a first person perspective '3D' walk through maze program.
I've kept it as elementary as possible to save time.  (You can still walk
right through walls.  The minimum size of a 'square' on the map is very
large.  There is no 'anything' to this demo other than walking in a 128x64
map.)

I've also kept it strictly 6809 code to make a point.  If a stock 6809 can do
THIS, imagine what a 6309 version would run like?

The program runs in 256x192 in 16 colors.  The graphics engine writes BYTES
to the screen to improve performance, but that limits the effective
resolution to 128x192.  Overall it runs at about 15 frames per second, give
or take a bit for variations in CPU power demanded.

The program breaks down to:
96K of 'RADAR TABLE' (Data table used to eliminate on the fly calculations)
16K of 'MAP' (The 128x64 playing area)
 1K of program code (actually, it's less than 1K.)

I don't have the time to make a game, but I just felt I had to make a point.
If anyone wants to make a first person perspective game out of this, contact
me and I'll send you the source code.
