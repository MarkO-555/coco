TRS-80 COLOUR COMPUTER 3 EMULATOR Ver. 1.6B (C) 1993-97 Jeff Vavasour
=====================================================================

(Visit http://www.vavasour.ca/jeff/trs80.html#coco3 for contact info.)

This is a quick summary of things you must know about the CoCo 3 Emulator, for 
those already familiar with the CoCo 2 Emulator.  Full details may be found in 
the COCO3.DOC file.

PC REQUIREMENTS:

- Full VGA-compatibility.
- 333K of free low memory.
- MS-DOS 3.3.

Recommended:

- MS-DOS 5.0 with an additional 96K of free low memory, EMS 4.0 and 384K 
  of free EMS memory.
- a fast CPU.

You will also need a real CoCo 3 to obtain a copy of the "Super Extended
BASIC" ROM as described below.  (Users intending to work exclusively in OS/9
Level II can bypass this requirement, see below.)

If you have the recommended memory requirements, the emulator will work as
a 512K CoCo 3.  Otherwise it will work as a 128K CoCo 3.

The CoCo 3 memory size is indicated on the title screen when you run the 
emulator.  Also, for quicker reference, the colour of the title screen's 
background will also reflect the memory size (blue if 128K, green if 512K).


OBTAINING THE ROM FROM A REAL COCO 3:
------------------------------------

This section outlines how to use a disk-based transfer method to obtain the 
ROMs from a CoCo 3.  See COCO.DOC on how to transfer the ROMs from diskless 
CoCo 3's.

1. Install the CoCo 3 emulator into a NEW DIRECTORY on your PC.  (It must NOT
   be in the same directory as the CoCo 2 emulator.)

2. Use the `PORT' program to write `GET3ROM.BAS' to a CoCo 3 disk.  (Before
   sending, press [F7] until a "BASIC" file type is selected, and then [F8] 
   until an "ASCII" format is selected.)

3. Take the disk to your CoCo 3 an RUN the GET3ROM.BAS program on it.  This
   disk must have at least 43K of free space.

4. Bring the disk with the ROM back to your PC, and run the `PORT' program
   again.  MAKE SURE THE "ADD/STRIP LFS" AND "ADD/STRIP EOF BYTE" OPTIONS
   ARE SET TO "NO".  (Use the [F5] and [F6] keys to change these settings.)

5. With the settings specified in step 4, tell PORT to move the files 
   "COCO3.ROM" and "DISK.ROM" from the CoCo disk to your MS-DOS directory.

The file "COCO3.ROM" should be 32258 bytes long, and "DISK.ROM" should be 
8194 bytes long.  If these are correct, you may now run the emulator by typing 
"COCO3" at the MS-DOS prompt.

If you have trouble reading the CoCo disk on your PC, try formatting a new
one on the PC using the DSKINI.EXE program.  Then, use that disk for the 
transfer process instead.  If the file lengths are wrong, check that settings 
in step 4 are correct and that there was enough space on the disk.

If you are using ADOS-3, see COCO3.DOC section 2.5 for details on how to
transfer this to the emulator.



CHANGES TO THE OPTIONS MENU:
---------------------------

The following options on the [F6] Options Menu are different in the CoCo 3
emulator:

[A] Keyboard.  A layout specifically designed for OS-9 is now available.

[B] Joysticks.  A "hi-res" mode is available wherein the mouse can be used
[C] to represent the hi-res joystick interface add-on used in CoCo Max III,
    etc.  At most, only one of [B] or [C] should be set to "hi-res" at any
    given time.

[E] Colour set.  The colours on a CoCo RGB monitor are different than on its
    Composite TV output.  You may choose either the RGB colour set, or a 
    crude approximation of the Composite colour set using this option.  Note
    that artifacting is not supported in the CoCo 3 emulator.

[F] Border colour.  Use this option to either force the screen border to be
    black, or to allow it to change to the colours used on the genuine 
    CoCo 3.

[H] Timers.  In addition to selecting a 60Hz or 50Hz clock as with the CoCo 2
    emulator, you can now enable the 16kHz horizontal sync and programmable
    timer interrupts.  BE WARNED THAT THIS MAY LOCK UP SLOW COMPUTERS OR 
    HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON SYSTEM PERFORMANCE.  If you find you can no longer
    run the emulator after changing this option, delete the file GENERAL.CC3
    in the emulator's directory.


SNAPSHOTS AND PROGRAM PAKS:
--------------------------

Snapshots from the CoCo 2 emulator are NOT compatible, however, Program Pak 
images from the CoCo 2 emulator CAN be used with the CoCo 3 emulator.  CoCo 3 
snapshots will be either 129K or 513K in length depending on whether the 
emulated CoCo had 128K or 512K of RAM.

See COCO3.DOC for information on how to obtain Program Pak images for either
machine.


KEYBOARD:
--------

The additional keys on the CoCo 3 keyboard are mapped as follows:

        CoCo 3 key:     PC key:
         BREAK           ESC
         CLEAR           HOME
         CTRL            CTRL
         ALT             ALT
         SHIFT-@         SCROLL LOCK
         F1              F11
         F2              F12

This keyboard map may be changed in the [F8] Keyboard Customization option.
Changes take effect when the "Custom" keyboard layout is selected via the
[F7] key.  Three standard layouts are available, one that matches the PC
keyboard for use in BASIC, one that matches it for use in OS-9, and one that
puts the keys in positions that most closely resemble the layout of the
original CoCo keyboard.


USING OS/9 LEVEL II WITHOUT THE COCO ROMS:
-----------------------------------------

OS/9 Level II requires the CoCo ROMs only so that you can execute the "DOS"
command.  You can bypass this requirement by installing the emulator's OS/9
boot loader, OS9BOOT.MOR.  This is done simply by typing the following command
at the MS-DOS prompt:

COPY OS9BOOT.MOR COCO3.ROM

Upon executing the emulator, the disk in the emulated CoCo's drive 0 (as 
specified in the virtual disk menu, see Section 4.1 for details) will now
automatically be booted.

You may still install the CoCo 3 ROMs at a later date by following any one of
the procedures in Sections 2.1 through 2.3 of COCO3.DOC.

Many other enhancements for OS-9 are also included.  See section 7.3 of
COCO3.DOC for details.
