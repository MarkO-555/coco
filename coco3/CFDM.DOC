 The files CFDM34S1.DSK and CFDM34S2.DSK are free sample copies of Rick's
 Computer Enterprise's COCO FRIENDS DISK MAGAZINE, in virtual disk format, 
 provided courtesy of Rick Cooper.  They may be used with the emulator after 
 you have installed the ROMs by selecting the Virtual Disk Menu (with [F2]), 
 pressing "0" to select drive 0, and then typing "CFDM34S1" as the disk name.

 ABOUT/USING COCO FRIENDS DISK MAGAZINE:

 CoCo Friends Disk Magazine (CFDM) is a monthly disk magazine devoted to those
 who still enjoy using RSDOS on their CoCo 3's.  The required equipment setup
 is a CoCo 3 with 128K of memory, RGB monitor, and one disk drive.  CFDM is
 provided on a flippie diskette.  The two files, CFDM34S1.DSK and CFDM34S2.DSK,
 contain the entire issue #34.  Just load drive 0 with CFDM34S1 and RUN"C" at
 the OK prompt.  When the startup screen appears, press ENTER to see the 
 cover picture or CTRL to jump right into the magazine.  At the MAIN MENU
 use the arrow keys to select a Section, then press ENTER.  Now choose an entry
 to view (don't choose Entry Writer) via the arrow keys and the ENTER key.
 Move from page to page by pressing and releasing CTRL followed by the 1, 2, or 
 3 key.  Press ESC to quit the entry.  There's a help screen available most of
 the time.  Just press the ALT key for help... any other key returns you to
 the CFDM display.  The programs, graphics, and music described on CFDM34S1
 can be found on CFDM34S2.  Always do a cold start after leaving CFDM34S1.
 
 CFDM will celebrate it's third year serving over 200 faithful CoCoists!  Our
 members enjoy sharing their programming, music, and graphics efforts with the
 group.  We also enjoy helping each other with programming and hardware 
 problems ("Questions & Answers"), reading about our Friends ("Family Tree"),
 sharing our knowledge and experience ("Articles", "Forum", "Potpourri"), 
 participating in various projects and contests, and creating new ways to keep
 our favourite computer alive!
 
 I hope you will enjoy the enclosed issue and decide to join our group.  [Jeff's

 thanks to Jeff Vavasour for giving the CoCo community a boost with his CoCo 3
 Emulator project!!
